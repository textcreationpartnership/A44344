         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE more eminent Matter of theſe Sermons, is <hi>our my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Union</hi> with <hi>God</hi> and Chriſt; a Subject but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled by <hi>Divines,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> but <hi>overly</hi> in compariſon to what thoſe other Benefits by Chriſt have been, that yet but flow from this, or do accompany it: So as any ſmal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Light into this Myſtery, is highly to be valued, ſpecially from ſo
<pb facs="tcp:66082:3"/>good a Hand, or Heart rather, ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experienced, and acutely inſighted, as was our Author.</p>
            <p>This Head, though it lay in the Road of another Courſe of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry the Author held, namely, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whol Work of the <hi>Application of our Redemption,</hi> in all the parts thereof (ſhortly to follow this into publick view, ſo far as he had proceeded in it) whereof this of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> was deſigned one (as by his Draught, or Scheme of that Work to be Prefaced to the whol, appears) and accordingly ſhould have been largely treated on, Subject wiſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by it ſelf in its due place and order. Yet whether it was that himſelf, fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending he might not live ſo long (as he did not) to arrive thereat in that Method (and yet withall conſidering the more ſpecial neceſſity of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this Age) he therefore did antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate this miſcellaneous Treatment of it, is not for us to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only we may ſurely affirm, that our all-wiſe God (who diſpoſeth of the <hi>Gifts, Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66082:3"/>and <hi>Operations</hi> of, and by his faithful Servants) he foreſeeing all, ſecretly guided him to this Precurſory handling of it in this way of Comment upon the ſeven laſt Verſes of Chriſts laſt Prayer; which we may well ſuppoſe to have been intended by himſelf, but as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary Eſſay of that more ample, and ſet Tractate on this Argument, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards intended; becauſe he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingleth therewith, Obſervations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other high, and glorious Goſpel Truths (whereof this Soyl, of al other Scriptures, muſt be ſuppoſed moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile) as the Text did give occaſion.</p>
            <p>And ſurely he was by the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hand as ſpecially directed, both, <hi>in his Choyce of this Scripture,</hi> for his Ground unto this Subject; which being the Concluſion of Chriſts moſt ſolemn laſt Prayer, muſt be ſuppoſed to expreſs the very bottom of his heart, and what lay deepeſt therein, and therfore came forth laſt: As alſo in the <hi>Occaſion</hi> on which he choſe to preach theſe Sermons which was <hi>then, when</hi> this <hi>Union</hi> is deſigned to
<pb facs="tcp:66082:4"/>be <hi>ſealed up</hi> to Beleevers more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly than in other Ordinances, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the <hi>Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper</hi> and towards his latter end: conjunct with the Solemnization whereof, even among his Apoſtles, it was that Chriſt did pour forth this Prayer unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his Death. And indeed <hi>he that is spiritual,</hi> and reads theſe Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will readily find, and muſt <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,</hi> that he was proportionably raiſed and aſſiſted by a Goſpel Spirit, as the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> of the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> of the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> meeting in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, did require; it being found in experience, that according to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Occaſion, and Sublimity of the Matter diſcourſed of, the Holy Ghoſt raiſeth, and enlargeth the Spirits of an holy man of God, that is experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in what he ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>The true ſtating the Bounds, for kind, or degree of that <hi>Union</hi> with God, which the Saints are admitted to by God, is of great uſe and neceſſity <hi>to this Age;</hi> the Fate whereof, is erring either
<pb facs="tcp:66082:4"/>on the right hand, or the left, in the greateſt Points of Religion, and in this Point, more groſsly and wretchedly than in any other, yea, and in the other (as may eaſily be obſerved) upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, firſt of a miſunderſtanding of this one, and particularly of ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and Clauſes in this Prayer of our Lord, which here have paſſed the ſearch and diſcovery of our Author, as <hi>[that they may be one as we are one, &amp;c.]</hi> which ſome have dared to interpret to be <hi>Unity,</hi> that is, <hi>Union, to be oneneſs in Nature</hi> with God himſelf; others to be at leaſt <hi>a ſameneſs of Union</hi> for kind, with that which the man Jeſus holds with the Natural Son of God; whereof one is a contradiction to the Nature of Creature, and Creator, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. the other to Chriſts being Mediator and Head between God and us, <hi>Of whom we</hi> ARE <hi>in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who is that <hi>one Lord,</hi> and <hi>we by him;</hi> his Union therefore Primary, and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; ours <hi>Secondary,</hi> and Derivative. Set but then, and keep the true diſtance
<pb facs="tcp:66082:5"/>between <hi>God</hi> and his Elect <hi>as Creatures,</hi> and between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and thoſe Elect, as whoſe <hi>all they are</hi> from God, <hi>is in and through Chriſt;</hi> ſo as that the Creature can never be one in Nature with God, who alone is <hi>bleſſed for ever,</hi> and that the Saints ſhal never be <hi>one Perſon</hi> with the Son of God, <hi>who is God bleſſed for ever.</hi> And whatever Unions or Communions with God, are, or can be ſuppoſed to be next to theſe two, to be ſure the Saints are, and ſhall be partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for next to himſelf, and his Son, they are Gods Beloved, and the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, what Glory, &amp; ſpiritual quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening our (Author giving the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Life-meaning</hi> of our Lord concerning this Union) an holy heart wil ſecretly, and ſuddenly find breaking in upon it, and it ſelf inſpired withal, in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: It wil together therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, without ſpeaking a word of ſet Confutation, all ſuch lewd miſtakes, which it is better to let ſleep, and vaniſh into eternal darkneſs, and ſilence, than
<pb facs="tcp:66082:5"/>to make mention of them.</p>
            <p>And upon al theſe accounts, we have great boldneſs to commend theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the VVorld, withal aſſuring the Reader, <hi>that they are all as they were penned under his own hand:</hi> Praying with all earneſtneſs, that the holy Spirit of Chriſt, who dwelt in the Author ſo richly, and bleſſed his preaching of them with ſo much life and power; yea, that filled our Savior Chriſts heart firſt in his praying, and uttering theſe words; and then his beloved Diſciples ſo many yeers after in the penning of them, would graciouſly accompany this quickning and Heavenly Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, to the hearts of al ſpiritual ſouls that read this.</p>

And being now ſhortly to offer up himſelf, and to lay down his life for his Children, and to go out of the World, (as though his ſoul had been tranſported into the Suburbs of Heaven, as though he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowel
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66082:15"/>his deareſt and heart-blood deſires into the boſom of his Father) he ſends this prayer before-hand in the power of his Interceſſion, to lie leidger there in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Diſciples and faithful ones, that ſo he might fully provide for their everlaſting life and ſpiritual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, before he left his own life, and provide comfort in Heaven to be ſent down to them, before he left the Earth, and went to Heaven.</p>
            <p>A Prayer of unconceiveable and incomparable worth, above al that ever was expreſſed or recorded in the word: Like a confection or compound of thoſe ſoveraigne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies; beyond the higheſt ſtrayn of the deſires or conceivings of the ſouls of the Saints.</p>
            <p>That which containes the quinteſſence or the pith of al the cordialls of the Goſpel; the very marrow of al that great redemption, he had wrought and purchaſed: the higheſt pitch of al that happineſs, which Heaven can afford, or the very richeſt Diamond in the crown of Glory: for that we may ſee, he here prayes for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond glory, that for which glory was made, and therefore better than glory it ſelf, for ſo the words: I have given them my Glory, that they may be one, as we are one. So that that is the end of Glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better than Glory, able to carry the heart beyond al the riches of admiration.</p>
            <p>This is expreſſed in the parts of it according to the parties for whom it is made, and thoſe are two.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66082:15"/>the Glory of God, the furtherance of his truth, or the good and benefit of ſuch, whoſe conditions or relations do moſt neerly touch us; for thus Prayer ſerves the end beſt, for which it is appointed by God, and for which it ſhould be uſed by us, to help forward the occaſions that be under our hands: Prayer is like the paſſing boat of the Ferry, it helps al Travellers, but it attends them next, that come firſt; So it was with <hi>Jacob,</hi> it plyed God for the particular, and eſpecially where the pinch lay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10.11.

            <p>The preſent work done, want to be ſupplied, the way of Providence furthered. Here is our prick and mark at which our prayers ſhould aim, we muſt not ſhoot at rovers, Prayer like a Skilful Phyſitian, ſtudies the cure of al diſeaſes, but adminiſters a receipt to him, whoſe neceſſities preſent themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Prayers muſt be of a ſpeeding nature ſo to attend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or things of preſent neceſſity, as to reach al in a right order.

                  </p>
                  <p>A man is unrighteous, and poſſeſſed of the power and preſence of it, and under the hand of revenging juſtice by reaſon of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And where may a righteouſneſs be found, which may anſwer the neceſſities of the Soul? the Law never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered this, the creatures never heard of it, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man could never reach it, nay the excellency of all the knowledg of all Angels was never able to deviſe: but Chriſt who came out of the Boſome of the Father, hath wrought this righteouſneſs and by the Goſpel hath brought life and Immortality to light (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.) which otherwiſe had never ſeen light, and therefore it is, that the glad tidings of peace is ſaid to come this way, and is not to be heard from any other coaſt. Tydings of evil come, like <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſſengers from every quarter, tidings we heare from the law, are nothing but threatnings and wrath, ready to condemn us: tidings from our own hearts are nothing but guilt and fear, to terrifie and arreſt us: tidings from Hell are yet worſe, there be nothing but accuſations ſubtil and Malicious, and thoſe preſent us, at home and abroad, in Earth and in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at Gods Tribunal, and require preſent execution to be done upon ſuch undeſerving creatures.

                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſinners. This is a faithful word and worthy of al acceptance and therefore the Soul looks out and ſaies, It <hi>may be.</hi> This keeps the Head above Water.</p>

                  <p>True. God is bound to none further then he will bind himſelf; and he binds himſelf in no wiſe to the creature, but by his promiſe, and that he wil never deny, who cannot deny himſelf.

For then it can avail no further, then the prayer of a man without ſin will do: and anſwerable to that kind of willing. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered them &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But its here the ſpecial work of Interceſſion, and proceeds from him, as God and man, Mediator of his elect and faithful, and ſo Interceſſion in their behalf: That being (as I told you) ſhortly to offer up himſelf, he ſends his prayer, as the great high Prieſt of his Church, in power of his Interceſſion, to lie Leidger there in the behalf of his beloved Children, that he might provide in Heaven for them, before he leſt the Earth. And this prayer is part of that Interceſſion he now puts ſorth, at the right Hand of the Father. So that the Sum in ſhort is.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66082:20"/>carrying an equal Eye unto all, without any Special reſtraint to any particular, of what quality or condition ſoever. Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave them that came unto God by him; (i.e.</hi> Who beleeve in him) <hi>ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them. i. e.</hi> For any of them, for every one of them, that ſhall beleeve. And therefore it was, when the high Prieſt was to go into the Holy of Holies, he was to bear the names of the twelve Tribes upon his Breaſt-plate <hi>i.e.</hi> The names of all the Saints, which ſhould profeſs the Faith, and by Faith beleeve in him. And it is the condition of the great work of our Redemption, it carries no reſpect of perſons with it (provided they be under the condition and terms of the covenant) it lies open unto all.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Jude</hi> ſpake of Salvation, its true of the whole work of Mediation and Interceſſion, <hi>Common Salvation: Common Interceſſon.</hi> In Chriſt Jeſus, nor Jew, nor Gentile, Graecian, nor Barbarian, Bond nor Free, Male nor Female. So that of Paul <hi>Rom. 5. If reconciled by his Death, when ſinners; much more ſhall we be ſaved by his life, being reconciled.</hi> If the death of our Saviour could purchaſe our Reconciliation; much more ſhal his life (now interceding in Heaven) be able to ſave us, i.e. All for whom he died.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Our Savior being in higheſt Honor and favor in the Court of Heaven, and of moſt perfect intelligence touching all the counſels, purpoſes, and proceedings of the Father: <hi>He there ſpeaks good unto God the Father, in our behalf dayly: ſets on going al the paſſages of Providence, in juſtice, and mercy, grace, and Truth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66082:21"/>Patience and Bounty, as may beſt anſwer al the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Churches, in al their conditions, as may moſt concern them:</hi> And anſwerably ſends an expreſs by the powerful operation of his good Spirit, into the Hearts of his people. So verſe. 11. <hi>Keep them through thin own name.</hi> Joh. 16.15. <hi>All things that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, are mine, therefore ſaid</hi> I, <hi>that he ſhal take of mine.</hi> Chriſt hath liberty to take of all the choiceſt of the Treaſures of Heaven, and thoſe he doth, and ſends them by the ſpirit unto the Hearts of his people. Joh. 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhal give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> Thus our Saviour doth us many ſecret kindneſſes, which we little conſider: and ſends privy Intimation, how things go in Heaven in our behalf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſtands betwixt us and our Harms by theſe his prayers and Interceſſion,</hi> and if there by any evil plotted, or intended againſt us, or hurt coming to us, he foreſees it, and way-laies it, that it may not be to our prejudice in any particular. The guilt of new ſins daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, freſh accuſations of conſcience, new pleas which Satan the accuſer of the Brethren would dayly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and put up unto divine juſtice againſt us.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour, he is our Advocate, undertakes our cauſe; pleads for us, and prevailes: gives in ſo ful ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction unto divine Juctice, that neither ſin, nor world, nor Satan, can be heard againſt us. Theſe ſins have been committed, theſe diſhonors done, theſe evils practiſed, ſaies Satan, and the world can witneſs, and their own conſciences. Yea ſaies divine Juſtice: Their Advocate hath been here, hath plainly and truly related all theſe; they are not new, and hath fully anſwered and ſatisfied to the utmoſt that can be exacted. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Here is the ground of the Apoſtles Triumph: <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, nay makes Interceſſion for us.</hi> So that there is neither condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor accuſation that can get any hearing againſt them,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66082:22"/>for they are al before diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and anſwered: the Lord Chriſt hath intelligence of their intendments, and diſappoints them wholly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He intercepts all our prayers and performances, which we tender up unto God, and perfumes them with the ſweet Odors of the incenſe of his own Interceſſion, and ſo they find acceptance, and make a pleaſant ſavor in the Noſtrils of the Almighty.</hi> As it is with brackiſh Water, which comes from the Sea, paſſing through ſome precious Gold or Silver Mines, it becomes, not only ſweet and purified, but of Soveraign vertue and taſt. So it is with our ſervices, being brackiſh with many baſe diſtempers, which cleave to them and us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercepted by the Interceſſion of our Saviour, and paſſing through the Rich mines of his Merits and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they prove marvailous pleaſing and acceptable to the Lord. Rev. 8.3. <hi>The prayers of the Saints are offered up, upon the Golden Altar of our Saviors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Merits.</hi> As an <hi>Advocate</hi> in the Court, if any of his Clients commend their cauſe to ska<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This was the Covenant and Agreement betwen God the Father and Chriſt. Thoſe that the Father in his counſel determined, he commended them all unto the care of our Savior, and gave him the liſt, as it were of their names, that he ſhould look, that none of them miſcarry: Our Saviour did freely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66082:22"/>that charge, for al thoſe ſo committed to his care: and therefore for al, muſt diſcharge that truſt alike. Joh. 6.37.38, 39, 40. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhal come to me &amp;c. For</hi> I <hi>came down from Heaven, not to do mine own wil, but the wil, of him that ſent me. And this is the wil of the Father, that of al which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe none. And this is his wil, that he that ſeeth and beleeveth ſhould have everlaſting life &amp;c.</hi> And he profeſſeth he was faithful herein. Joh. 10.14, 15, 16. I <hi>am the good Shepherd:</hi> I <hi>lay down my life &amp;c. And I have other Sheep, and they muſt come.</hi> And therefore when he hath gathered al his elect, and brought in his tally, <hi>Here am I,</hi> and the Children thou haſt given me, He ſhall then reſign up the Kingdom to the Father.</item>

               <p>If Chriſt hath undertaken for all alike. If it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto all: If it be alike needful for all: Then its that which Chriſt intends to al his.</p>

                  <p>Its impoſſible for a beleever to periſh, to looſe his Grace, to fal away, either totally, or finally from Chriſt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66082:23"/>and ſo to be deprived in the Iſſue of eternal life. I Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus;</p>
                  <p>That which our Savior died for, prayed for, and doth now make Interceſſion in Heaven for that, he can never fail to attain.</p>
                  <p>But for the perſeverance of the Saints, and for their everlaſting Salvation, he died, and he did Pray, and doth pray at this day for.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he cannot but attain his end, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their happineſs.</p>
                  <p>So he profeſſeth, and hath left it upon record, to eſtabliſh the Faith of al His, in their greateſt ſhocks. Joh 11.41, 42. <hi>Father, I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me; And</hi> I <hi>knew that thou heareſt me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt hath here proclaimed it, we may conclude, and that undoubtedly, that which he knows, who could not be deceived: we may know it for a truth, and that it wil never deceive us. Chriſt is ever heard, and therefore the Saints ſhal alwaies be aſſiſted, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, inabled to be faithful to the end, and in the end. If Chriſt may not be heard, then thou maieſt not be helped: and if he wil looſe his prayer, then thou maieſt looſe thy comfort and grace. But that is incredible, this is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Beſides how diſhonorable is this Doctrine of falling away, unto the Lord Jeſus, and the work of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in the Iſſue advanceth the power of our ſin, and the policy of Satan, above the vertue of the death of Chriſt, and the power of the prayer of Chriſt; For it ſaith thus much: That the policy of Satan is more able to undermine us, than his prayer to preſerve us: His temptation to deſtroy us, than the Interceſſion of Chriſt to ſave us.</p>
                  <p>No, Be the aſſaults never ſo fierce, the allurements never ſo ſubtil, corruptions never ſo ſtrong, Nay let all the power of Darkneſs do the worſt. The prayer of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66082:23"/>Chriſt wil yet ſhore up the meaneſt Saint in the greateſt ſafety: <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. Satan hath deſired to winnow (he would have winnowed all the Grace out of his Heart, but our Savior he made proviſion for him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes) but I have prayed, that thy Faith fail not, and there leaves it, as though there was not then the leaſt ſhadow or fear of any miſcarriage. For it might have been ſaid: may be, Satan wil be too hard, not only for my Grace, but for thy prayer: No, our Savior leaves it beyond al queſtion, for its ſo far from any appearance of probability, that the thought of it is no leſs than blaſphemy.</p>

Yet here ye ſee, our Savior takes in al thoſe now within the compaſs of his prayer and care, to provide for them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive all for their good, when they neither did, nor could care for him, or for themſelves: therefore its plain.</p>
               <p>Our Savior cares for ſuch, who ſhal beleeve in him, when they are in the depth of their unbeleef: and his prayer is then working for their good, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no good unto themſelves. Our Savior, when they were in the heat of that helliſh villany, in blaſpheming, and killing the Lord of life, even then he intends life to them, procures and purchaſeth life for them. Luk. 23, 34. <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> This prayer it was, that wrought more than <hi>Peters</hi> preaching, when his ſpirit was warmed with the Love of Jeſus, and the Blood of a dying Savior ran freſh now, in al the Veins of his Heart, and the power and vertue of it was mighty upon the conſciences of <hi>Peters</hi> Hearers, ſuch, as had before been Crucifyers of the Lord of life. It then took place and prevailed mightily. Iſa. 57.18. <hi>I have ſeen his waies, &amp;c,</hi> though he ſee not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>See this made good in ſome particulars, as

               </p>
               <p>This care, and the vertue of this prayer of our Savior will appear thus, in five Particulars.</p>
               <p>Hence 1. It is, that the Lord contrives means in the waies of his. Providence for the bringing of theſe men into the world, ſo that the Parents and Predeceſſors of ſuch, though happily deſperately wicked and forlorn, ſhal yet have their ſtock and poſterity continued in the world; becauſe they ſhal bring theſe into the world, who ſhal beleeve. And therefore it is, the patience of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66082:26"/>God is extended towards many a wicked parent, nay to the whole ſtock and Linage of vile and looſe men; not for their ſakes, but the ſakes and cauſe of ſome that ſhal come of them, whom the Lord Chriſt doth purpoſe to bring to himſelf. Math. 24.22. Had not God ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe daies, no fleſh had been ſaved: but for his Elects ſake, the Lord ſhortned thoſe daies. <hi>i.e.</hi> The genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews now rejecting and moſt Helliſhly blaſpheming the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, had ſo provoked the Eyes of the Lord; That ſhould he in Juſtice have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt them, and executed his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either as the Nature of their ſins deſerved, or their Enemies intended, and out of their power and rage could eaſily have accompliſhed it, there had not been one Jew left alive to propagate their poſterity, or name, or Nation.</p>
               <p>But the Lord had an Eye to his Elect, that ſhould come of theſe, in the laſt Age of the world, after ſo many Ages and generations paſt, when their dead Bones ſhal live, and the Redeemer ſhal come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and turn <hi>Jacob</hi> from iniquity, then all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhal be ſaved: So the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. Hated for their ſins ſake: but beloved for their Fathers ſake, <hi>i.e.</hi> For <hi>Abraham,</hi> with whom, through Chriſt, the covenant of the Goſpel was made to him, and to his Seed: <hi>i.e.</hi> To al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether Jew or Gentile: but with the Jew firſt, and then with the Graecian. For this calling and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, being everlaſting, is without repentance, and wil aſſuredly take place, in the ſeaſon thereof, when it ſhal be moſt ſutable to ſhew forth free grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord even ſo provides, that ſuch means in an ordinary way of Providence, may be ſent, continued, and diſpenſed to ſuch, who never had a thought of them, enquired after them, or had a Heart to entertain them, when they are offered. Upon this ground the Lord appoints, and incourageth the Apoſtle. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.9, 10. <hi>Speak and hold not thy Tongue:</hi> Speak plainly and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66082:26"/>fully, fear no mans frowns, regard no mans favors, no man ſhal do thee harm: for I have people in this City. Thus the Spirit ſtopped the paſſage into <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> for when they aſſayed, the Spirit ſuffered them not. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.7. But Chriſt ſends poſt, by an expreſs in a Viſion to <hi>Paul;</hi> A man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> appeares, with this Petition in his Hand, ſubſcribed by the Hearts of the meſſengers, <hi>Come into</hi> Macedonia, <hi>and help us.</hi> And when they came, the Iſſue ſhewes their Errand, A poor Woman, a Purple-ſeller, and a Stubborn and Rebellious ſpirited Jailour, was all the Markets he made.</p>
               <p>But this is the Lords manner: if there be but one Grain of Corn in many heapes of Chaff, he wil never leave winnowing, rather than loſe it: ſend he wil, Meſſenger after Meſſenger, until he hath gathered that into his barn. <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> a Runnagate from his Maſter, without the reach of government of Goſpel: God coops him up in Priſon, and caſts <hi>Paul</hi> thither alſo, that ſo he may come to the ſpeech of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He keeps them by his reſtraining Grace, and ſome ſtrong hand of Providence, ſometimes from groſſer ſins (I ſay ſome of thoſe that ſhal beleeve from ſome loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and hainous evil) but alwaies, from falling into that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: becauſe that is a Diſeaſe which admits no Remedy, a Dungeon of that depth from whence there is no deliverance: beyond the reach of the work of Redemption, as that which comes not within the compaſs of mercy, and the Riches of the compaſſion of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>The Lord hath paſſed the ſentence, and that moſt Peremptory, and ſhews the deadly Malignity of that evil, by way of difference from all others. Math. 12.31. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall be forgiven unto men; but the Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven, in this world, nor in the world to come. i.e.</hi> There is no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66082:27"/>Hope. It here cannot be pardoned: and at the great day he ſhal never be acquitted; neither here done, nor then declared. So that ſuch a perſon hath the Tombſtone of everlaſting deſtruction turnd upon him &amp; ſealed: paſt Hope and help. And therefore the Apoſtle puts it upon an impoſſibility. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. How far that goes, I wil not now diſpute, whether in regard of the covenant of the Goſpel, the counſel of the Lord, the Decree of the Almighty, that he ſhal never have Grace give him to repent: for then it ſhould not ſo much aggravate the hainouſneſs of the ſin: becauſe from impenitency and final preſev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rance in any ſin, its not poſſible ſuch ſhould be recovered; and this great evil upon this ground ſhould have no other impoſſibility than many other. And withal the impoſſibility ſhould then ly in Gods counſel, and definitive purpoſe, not in the Nature of the evil, which anſwers not the terrible expreſſion of the wrath of God in the Text.</p>
               <p>But however it is, it is ſafe and ſure to Joyn Iſſue with the word of truth, and to take that upon truſt. Its impoſſible ſuch a one ſhould be renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And therefore its impoſſible, a man, whom Chriſt hath ordained to beleeve and repent, ſhould ever fal into that evil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. However the Lord many times, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, and his infinite good pleaſure, ſuffers ſome, and many of thoſe, whom he will afterwards effectually cal, to be overtaken with moſt loathſom abominations, yet he ever over-rules and over-works al thoſe Helliſh miſcarriages of theirs, for the furtherance of his own work in them, when he ſeriouſly ſets upon the accompliſhment of it.</p>
               <p>Somtimes there is no waies to cure Poyſon, but with Poyſon: no means to cruſh the pride and ſelf-confidence and overweening conceit of a mans own worth, but to leave him to himſelf, that he may bedaub himſelf with ſome dirty and deteſtable diſtemper; that ſo his own
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66082:27"/>experience may evidence his own baſeneſs, and force him to put his Mouth in the Duſt, and cover himſelf with confuſion: when, through his own ſelf deceiving appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, he could never either ſee it, or bring his heart to be humbled for it before the Lord. Thus many, who in former times have ſoothed up themſelves, with the glorious appearance of a formal profeſſion, ſo that they could keep out, or wipe off, al the convictions that were preſented before them: At length the Lord leaves them to ſome noyſom luſts, one is overtaken with bruitiſh Drunkenneſs, another with ſome baſe uncleanneſs: and ſo the breaking of the impoſtume, and the venting of thoſe vile evils, conſtraines their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to condemn themſelves, for rotten; when the evidence of the word could not: and this hath been the occaſion of the through converſion of ſome men.</p>
               <p>Somtimes again, the Lord takes ſome men out of a ſink, to make them mirrors of the power of his ſaving mercy to al poſterity: The greatneſs of their ſin, was the occaſion, why their Hearts, were pierced for al ſin. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36, 37. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the time appointed and determined before, in the counſel of the Lord is come, then the prayer of our Savior ever takes place, and makes the means effectual and prevailingly ſucceſſeful for the good of ſuch, for whom he hath taken the care. Joh. 10.16. I <hi>have other ſheep, which are not yet of this fold,</hi> (ſuch as in his counſel, were ordained to life, yet not called to the ſaving knowledg of the truth:) <hi>them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe wandering ſheep, that are gone aſtray from the walks of the Lord, yet he muſt bring: he muſt pluck the Adulterer from his luſts, and the Drunkard from his Cups, and worldling, who hath been Buried in his earthly occaſions, theſe ſhall hear his voice; they are within his Ken, and under his care, and he provides for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66082:28"/>their good, though they intend no good unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So Chriſt to <hi>Paul;</hi> (he is then pitying, while he is perſecuting; he comes to ſave him, when he purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deſtroy himſelf:) <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me? Act.</hi> 9. So, Again he ſends a Phyſitian to him. <hi>Ananias, go &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the Soveraignty of Gods wil, who looks at nothing in the creature, for which he ſhould be moved to do good unto it, but only his good wil and pleaſure, according to which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e curves out his compaſſion as ſuits with his own liking. Rom. 11.7. <hi>The Election hath obtained it:</hi> its not in the power of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And therefore hence it is, He ſhews mercy, becauſe he wil ſhew mercy: and he it is that raiſeth up a mighty Salvation for his people, when they were in the depths of their ſins and confuſions alſo. Luk. 1.69. Ezek. 16.6. <hi>I ſaw her in her Blood, and then</hi> I <hi>ſaid, Live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The Riches of Gods mercy in Chriſt, and the ſcope of our Saviors coming, it is to deſtroy the work of Satan, and to bring life out of death, and light out of Darkneſs. Rom. 5. and laſt. <hi>That where ſin abounded, Grace hath abounded much more.</hi> That is the aim of the place; why then was the Law given, ſince the Law could not ſave, but only Chriſt? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was, that ſin might abound: when corruption was diſcovered, oppoſed, and provoked, then it was made out of meaſure ſinful. That where ſin hath abounded, Grace alſo might much more abound. <hi>q.d.</hi> The Lord Chriſt would redeem his people, let the Devil and ſin do their worſt. So the Apoſtle again diſputes, Rom. 5.8. <hi>God commended his love to us, that when we were ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Lord painted and limned out the ſurpaſſing excellency of his love in moſt lively Colors.</p>
               <p>Its the ſcope alſo of the coming of our Savior. <hi>He came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to Repentance.</hi> He was not to find them bleſſed, but to make them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66082:28"/>ſo. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.5. Chriſt was formed from the Womb, to be his ſervant, that he might bring <hi>Jacob</hi> again. Its he that leaves the ninty nine in the Wilderneſs, and goes to ſeek up that which was loſt in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>If the Soveraignty of Gods good pleaſure appointed this; The Riches of his free Grace and the ſcope of our Saviors coming intended this: then certainly our Savior would carefully accompliſh it: but the antecedent is ſuch: therefore the conſequent.</p>

                  <p>Here ſee the different diſpenſation of the dealing of the Lord in the waies and works of his providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men of the ſame quality, and that in the ſame condition, men as ſinful, one as another, and under the power of their ſin, and in an unregenerate ſtate both of them: Yet the counſel of God and the care of our Savior Chriſt is farr different, even ſurpaſſing mans imagination and thought.</p>
                  <p>Be they both unbeleevers now for the preſent, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to his Grace, and oppoſers of his word, and the work of his ſpirit, and it may be with greater out-rage and violence, the one more than the other? And yet the Lord may do nothing but in love, and out of mercy to the one; intercede now in Heaven, order al creatures, and overwork al occaſions in Earth, for the good of the one, and do nothing for the other; but there is a hand of Juſtice, and the Poyſon of his diſpleaſure, which firſt or laſt, either in the entrance, or in the Iſſue, wil be an ingredient in every paſſage of Gods providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: Let them both have the ſame outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, its Diet to the one, ſurfet to the other poyſon to the one, and a preſervative to the other: the one wil be quickned and inlarged to God by it with thankfulneſs, the other becomes proud, inſolent towards men, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and negligent towards God.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:66082:29"/>
                  <p>Let them both be under the ſame Rod and correction, the one wil be made more humble, and the Heart wil be wrought to a more watchful care to walk more awfully before the Lord: the other wil be made more frampful and preverſe and hardned in a ſelf willy erring frame of Spirit. Thus ſome expound that of <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.15. God who had ſeparated him from the Womb, had ſet him a part in his counſel and purpoſe to ſuch a ſervice, and even from the Womb, in his education and courſe of life, and ſtudyes, he was ſevering and ſuiting of him for his own turn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it wil be ſaid; do not we ſee by proof and experience; that even the deareſt ſervants of the Lord, before their converſion pervert even the bounty and bleſſing of the Lord, to the increaſe of their ſin and haſting of their ruin? The learning and wiſdome of <hi>Paul</hi> lifts up his Heart in pride, and ſets on his ſpirit to preſecute the Church. He profited more than his equals: and breathed out threatnings more than they al. How are theſe then fruits of mercy, when they are thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed to a man? and indeed can be no other, for an unbeleeving Heart wil ſuck Poyſon out of the ſweeteſt bleſſing the Lord beſtows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are bleſſings as they come from God, and as he give them, they prove Curſes; as the Heart that is yet graceleſs abuſeth them: they are preſervatives, as they come from the Hand of the almighty, and he adminiſters them: they are turned to Poyſon, as a corrupt Heart perverts them to its own hurt. As the Phyſitian out of love and wiſdom adminiſters a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom potion, but a foul ſtomack turns it al into matter of an ill Humor, and ſo a Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>And yet alſo I anſwer in the Second place; That in the Iſſue, at the laſt, the Lord even out-bids all, and over-works all; even the abuſe of all bleſſings, the the furfeting upon al his kindneſſes, to the further abaſing of the ſoul, fearful and thankful walking before
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66082:29"/>him, when once he is effectually brought home. There is a ſpecial Confection made out of the kindneſſes, and our corrupt diſtempers, for our deeper Humiliation, in <hi>regard</hi> of our ſelves and admiration, in regard of Gods goodneſs. As it was ſaid of them in Egypt, ſo the Pſalmiſt applies it to al, <hi>The Lord doth marva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence alſo we have an anſwer to the cavil of the Papiſts, who plead, that Chriſt doth not bear al the puniſhment which the Saints deſerve: For ſay they, before their converſion, when they were not in the ſtate of Grace, nor in Chriſt, thoſe afflictions that were laid on them, muſt needs be true puniſhments, and iſſue from divine Juſtice revenging, not from the love of a Father correcting: &amp; therefore Chriſt may ſuffer for the pardon of al their ſins, and yet not bear al their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They do come from the love of a Father, who in his counſel hath determined it, and in Chriſt hath fully tranſacted it, though it is not yet actually either beſtowed, or received of them in the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Know it was from the care, and through the vertue of the prayers of Chriſt, that you came into this world, that he firſt time of your breathing had not been the firſt time of your damning. He hath rocked your Cradles, nurſed you at your Mothers Breaſts, trained you up in your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years, taken care of you, and then prayed for you, when you did not, could not, pray for your ſelves: Oh the Riches of that Mercy!</p>
                  <p>Will not every Man ſay, cannot each Man confeſs it, had I continued in ſuch a place, converſed with ſuch wretched company, with whom I was ſomtimes linked and confederate, had not the Lord freed me from thoſe ſnares, delivered me from thoſe temptations: had he not born with the baſeneſs of my Heart, but taken the advantage againſt me, and ſnatched me away, when I was poſting down to Hell, in the eager purſuit of ſuch and ſuch baſe luſts; there had been no poſſibility, but I had periſhed.

                  <p>Nay had he but let Satan looſe upon me, or mine own corruptions looſe within me, unto which I was addicted, and which was my delight and life: This wretched Heart had never come to an end, nor meaſure in ſin.

                  <p>Nay, when I lay ſecure and ſenſeleſs in my ſin, and never thought of means, nor ever ſought for them, he ſent them: though I was careleſs, he continued them, when there was no Eye to pity me, nor I had a Heart to pity my ſelf, yet when he ſaw me in my Blood, he ſaid, live, Poor creature, live. Oh the Riches of that mercy of a Chriſt!</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſuch was the rebellion and Enmity of this wretched Heart, that I rejected life it ſelf, took up Armes againſt the Almighty &amp; the offer of his mercy, and profeſſed I would none of that Grace of his, that might pardon, that holineſs that might purge and purifie this vile Heart, none of that life and Power of his that might quicken me, nor hear, though he counſelled never ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would not yield to his convictions, nor come in to thoſe earneſt intreaties.</p>

            <p>To pray and purchaſe that for his faithful ones, that they, who are, by nature and ſin, enemies againſt him, and oppoſite unto him, may in a proportionable manner, as far, as their meanneſs is capable, be as near to him, as he to his Father: a Poor creature durſt not have begd ſo Rich a favor, could not expect it, and is hardly brought to beleeve it poſſible. As he: Is it true indeed, that God will dwell in a Tabernacle made with hands? behold, the Heaven of Heavens is not able to contain him, how much leſs, this Houſe, this Heart? or as he: <hi>I am not worthy, thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof.</hi>

               <p>I muſt crave leave under favour and correction to ſtep aſide from the common Road, the uſual apprehenſion of many Interpreters; whoſe Judgment and knowledg I highly prize and reverence, and with whom I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to concur, and eaſily ſo ſhould, but that Evidences out of the Text (to my ſeeming and ſhallowneſs at leaſt) are ſo cleer, that they conſtrain my Judgment to go a little aſide. I Anſwer therefore;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Negatively.</hi>

               <p>This unity of amity, of love, and mutual and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cord, is not the chief aim and intendment of the Text, nor yet the purpoſe of the prayer of our Savior. Though indeed it may be collected and inferred from this: and to my apprehenſion, the very letter doth look another way, and ſpeaks aloud touching another thing. For ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The words immediately following are marvailous plain and expreſs, <hi>That they may be one in us.</hi> True it is, they ſhould be, and thoſe that have the ſame ſpirit. of love, as the ſame ſoul in many members, they wil be of one and the ſame affection each to other: but that Chriſt now prayes for, which preſuppoſeth this, and is indeed the foundation thereof, is, Namely, <hi>that they be one in us:</hi> and then they wil be at unity, one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Yea the very manner of ſpeech, laid down by way of compariſon and reſemblance, ſeems to be added, as a further clearing and interpretation, of that which went before. That which was propounded there in the general, here comes more fully to be explicated; As though our Savior had ſaid, when I pray that al beleevers may be one, my meaning may thus be conceived, and my intendment rightly underſtood by this reſemblance. As I am in the Father, and the Father in me: the ſcope of my prayer is; that they ſhould be one in us, after their manner.</p>
               <p>Again when our Savior ſets down the order, how he would have this unity attained and preſerved, the ſpeaks ful verſe 23. <hi>I in them and thou in me,</hi> and ſo they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66082:34"/>ſhal be made perfect into one <hi>q. d.</hi> If they all be in me, as I am in thee, then are they in unity: and thou being in me, and I in them, then are they perfected in this unity: As they are one in me, and ſo in thee, by ſpiritual dependance, to receive al: So I am one in them and thou in me, by ſpiritual influence, and we communicate al unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second reaſon is out of verſe 22. Where the Glory, which Chriſt hath received and given to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, is made a means to obtain this unity. <hi>The glory, which thou haſt given to me,</hi> I <hi>gave to them, that they may be one, as we.</hi> Whence it follows by undeniable evidence; This unity is one Stayr and degree beyond the glory it ſelf, which the Saints receive: For its a rule-caſe in reaſon, the end is more excellent, and of greater worth and goodneſs, than the means appointed for the end. Unity of affection among the Saints is part of that glory, or an ingredient which makes up the glory of the Saints, but this unity is the end of that glory, and ſo more excellent; therefore ſomthing beyond that, or any ingredient in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer <hi>affirmatively</hi> in a word,</p>
               <p>The unity here meant is the unity of that ſpiritual relation which they have to Chriſt, and in him to God the Father; not the unity of affection or charity, which they have one to another, and one between ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>That which is more excellent than this unity of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as being the end unto that, is ordained unto that, as the end, that muſt be ſomthing beyond it: ſo this unity is.</p>
               <p>That which is properly bounded by the words of the text, and intendment of the place, upon Chriſt, and the Father in him; That unity is not the unity of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of relation.</p>
               <p>But this unity, by the expreſs teſtimony of the truth and Text is bounded upon the Father in Chriſt: That
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66082:34"/>they may be one in us. therefore the unity here intended is that of relation, not of affection.</p>
               <p>We have now gained the firſt: what kind of unity this is. We are now to inquire, wherein this conſiſts, or how it may be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>The explication of this, wil be the interpretation of the words of the Text, which follow; which are applied (as far as yet I can conceive by the moſt ſad conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) unto this very purpoſe now in hand. For when our Savior had prayed; That they might be one; That they might aright underſtand it, and ſo, the exceeding love of Chriſt; who did not ſeek, nor ſo obtain (for he is ever heard in what he asks) any mean or ordinary bleſſing, or common courteſie for them, for their preſent comfort and refreſhing. But the choiceſt mercy, a bleſſing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable worth and ſurpaſſing excellency; That, I ſay, they might underſtand this and receive ſutable comfort for it; He addes, by way of explication, what he meaneth, with as much plainneſs, as ſuch a ſpiritual myſtery, which touched the very inward Heart-Blood of our happineſs could be diſcovered. <hi>q. d.</hi> If you ask what I mean by this unity, and whereby it may de diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: I anſwer by this familiar compariſon: As I am in the Father, and he in me, ſo I wiſh, they may be one in us. So that here we muſt unfold,
<list>
                     <item>1. How the Son is one in the Father, &amp; he one in him.</item>
                     <item>2. Then conceive after what manner the Saints and beleevers muſt be one in them, for this Chriſt hath prayed: this he hath obtained: this ſhall undoubtedly be received.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Both which I cannot tel how more nakedly to lay open, than to expreſs in ſeveral ſhort propoſitions, or concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ground of this reſemblance, taken from the manner of the Sons being in the Father, is not to be attended, nor ought to be conſidered in regard of the God Head or eſſence of the Deity: but in regard of their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66082:35"/>ſubſiſtence, as they be diſtinct perſons in this their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. Therefore the word is in the plural: One in us, as ſhewing the number of the perſons: beſides, they are put by way of particular diſtinction each to other; the Father in the Son, the Son in the Father, not ſo much as mentioning, nor yet taking the God-Head into the compariſon, is common to them both indifferently; as I am in thee, not in the God-Head: thou in me, not as both in the God-Head, for that was to be one in a third, not in themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their being each in other, iſſues out of the mutual reſpect they have each unto the other. The Father whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and alone gives his being and ſonſhip unto Chriſt: The Son, as he receives, ſo he returnes his being to the Father, as relates, or things in relation, look each to other alone, receive and give conſiſtence one to another, and depend each upon other, in that behalf, and ſo to be in the other mutually, their very conſtitution and being, riſing from this concurrence, mutual holding each upon the other; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o may be truly ſaid to be in each other. As buying is in refe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nce ever to ſelling. Giving ever in reference to taking: ſo that one cannot be without the other, give being each to other, and ſo may be ſaid to be in each other.</p>
               <p>So the Father, as ſuch, looks only to the Son: the Son looks only to the Father. He is not a Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, but, becauſe he hath a Son. The Son is not therefore Son, becauſe he is God, but becauſe he hath a Father: for they are both equally one God and have the Deity indifferently agreeing to them both. As a man is not therefore a Husband, becauſe he is a man, for then every man ſhould be a husband, but in reference to the Woman he hath married.</p>
               <p>And hence the Father is ſaid to be in the Son, and the Son in the Father, namely to be one in this mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. The Father had an Eye only to the Son in giving his ſubſiſtence of a Son: The Son again hath an Eye to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66082:35"/>the Father alone, returning the being of his ſonſhip to him. And they are prefect in this; They wholly give, wholly take. Thus they are ſaid to be in each other. Joh. 14.10. <hi>Beleeveſt thou not, that</hi> I <hi>am in the Father, and the Father in me?</hi> ſo ſaid again, to be one with another, and delighting one in another. Prov. 8.30. And mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to glorifie one another. <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, that thy Son may glorifie thee.</hi> Joh. 17.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſecond perſon in the glorious Trinity ſo takes our Human Nature into perſonal Union with him, that he is the ſame perſon he was, no other, and it becomes one perſon with him, leanes upon him, hath his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from him, &amp; looks alone to him for his ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>As a Son, he aſſumes our Nature, and as a Son with our Nature looks to the Father. Therefore ſaid, he doth nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the Father do. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo he hath given to he Son, to have life in himſelf becauſe the Son of man verſe, 26.27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the Father is ſaid to beget his Son, and give being to him, ſo the Son, as thus begotten aſſumes our Nature, be comes the Head of the covenant and gives being of Sonſhip to his Children, and they returne al that being to the Lord Chriſt, and the Father in him Therefore called the eternal Father. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.1, 3. Here am I, and the Children thou haſt given me called alſo his ſeed. The manner of which words may thus be conceived.</p>
               <p>The Lord hath purchaſed the Spirit, he is ſaid then to beget, when he ſends the ſpirit of Sons in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o their Hearts, which by the immutable aſſiſtance thereof, ſets their hearts for God, holds the bent thereof towards him alone, as their Father, and principle of life. As they receive this being of Sons they returne it wholly to the Father in Chriſt: The whole man, in the whol, and that with his whol ſtrength, faſtens upon God in Chriſt, acted wholly by the influence of his ſpirit, and holds the not excellency thereof.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:66082:36"/>
               <p>The Sum of all, out of all that hat been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is the chiefeſt priviledg for which Chriſt prayes, and beleevers can partake of, as their peculiar good in themſelves.</p>
               <p>I add that, <hi>In themſelves;</hi> becauſe there be higher ends than this, in the Text: To-wit, the ſetting up of God in Chriſt in the Conſciences of the ungodly, that they may be forced to confeſs, that God ſent his Son to this end; That he loved them, as he loved Chriſt. There is yet another and higher end: That they may behold and wonder, and be ſwallowed up in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the glory of Chriſt, which the Father hath given him.</p>
               <p>Enquire here, how far Chriſt being in the Saints, and his love in them, may yet be a higher end, than this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is not the unity of affection between each other ſo much, but the unity of relation to God in Chriſt: That as the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, by eternal generation; Beleevers ſo ought to be in both, by ſpiritual Adoption.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In this Spiritual Adoption,</hi> as there is an influence from God in Chriſt, to bend and ſettle the frame of the Heart towards him: So there is a re-fluence and return, by the power and impreſſion left of the ſame ſpirit to come again to him. Conveyance of help on Gods hand ſhould quicken our dependance to look to him, and ſtay our ſelves with him there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Had <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, his poſterity, out of principles, in themſelves, might have challenged happineſs, though a covenant performed by a man, conveyed by a man, unto them, by way of natural generation.</p>
               <p>But in the covenant of the Goſpel, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſecond perſon, taking our Nature, by the power of the Deity, wrought al for us, communicates al to us: by the ſame almighty power, inables us to receive what we have from him: To be acted in al by him; To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all to him. The mutable principle in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66082:36"/>never brought a man to God, nor kept him with him: But the mutable preſence and Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So that there is a priviledg here above that principle of Grace that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> for that was but a creature. But here the ſpirit and ſo the power of God through Chriſt, that takes our Nature into the neereſt union with him, even perſonal, which in <hi>Adam</hi> it attained not, in that purchaſeth all for us. Not a principle in us firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the ſpirit of God in Chriſt it is, by which, the bent of our Hearts are held and carried towards him, acted by him, and ſo inabled to hold out the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, power, praiſe, and excellency of the ſpirit in Chriſt from the Father.</p>
               <p>So that a poor creature is compaſſed about with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but whith the power of God in Chriſt, and becomes one with Father and Son in their mutual relation to them, and totall dependance upon them. And this is above the innocency and excellency of <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and all that he could attain unto; and above all created Grace in Heaven, being wholly taken up with God in Chriſt, and looſe our ſelves in God and Chriſt. Eph. 4.13. <hi>The acknowledgment of the Son of God.</hi> It was not the Son of man that did it: The Son of God, that recovered us, held the bent of our hearts to him, acted us, kept us, perfected us, crownes us. <hi>God ſhal be all in all.</hi> The Father gives being to the Son, returnes all to the Father, and that eternal generation, and ſo one. The Lord Chriſt, as a ſon, and begotten of the Father, gives us the being of Children by Adoption, ſets us, and holds us. We take al, acted by him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him. As the Father in Chriſt gives all, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and to the Father through Chriſt we return al, and ſo we are one in the Father and the Son.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this is the ſcope of our Saviors coming into
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66082:37"/>the world, and the next end, I ſay, the next end he intended in the great work of Redemption, which he wrought for loſt man; To bring him into this neer relation of deareſt Love of the Father, by himſelf and the work of his ſpirit: and its that wherein the life and power and pith of the covenant of Grace, doth eſpecially conſiſt and appeare, and the excellency thereof.</p>
                  <p>That peculiar and ſpiritual intercourſe, not alone of affection, but of divine operation of God upon the ſoul, whereby the ſoul returns all unto God, to do al, and to receive all, to do all for himſelf in man, and to receive all to himſelf by man.</p>

                  <p>It was that which was plotted by the Head and policy of Satan, and brought about by the fal and through the folly of our firſt parents; <hi>To break off this unity and Oneneſs betwixt God and</hi> Adam: For Satan had found it by woful experience in himſelf, that by ſin God would be eſtranged from him, and he alſo from God: neither to find his favour towards him, nor the preſence of his ſpirit of Grace to work upon him: nor yet would <hi>Adam,</hi> thus departed, act for God, nor return to him that praiſe he ought: So that God and <hi>Adam</hi> are not one, but at odds.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:66082:37"/>
                  <p>Its the meaning of that place. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19, 20. When the Apoſtle had ſhewed the weakneſs of the Law, in the work of Juſtification, and the promiſe only carried it; He makes thig Objection; <hi>wherefore then ſerved the Law,</hi> i.e. The giving of the Law? Anſwer; It was to diſcover tranſgreſſion; and therefore it was given by the Hand of a Mediator, to-wit <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was between God and the people.</p>
                  <p>Now, in that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Mediator, it ſhews there was diverſe parties differing and diſagreeing one from another: for a Mediator is not of one: not of parties that are at unity and agreement; but God is one, ever like himſelf and the ſame. Therefore the cauſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was not on Gods part, but by Reaſon of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; which ſhews man to be other, than he was by Nature, ful of guilt and ſin, and that's the reaſon God is at odds with him, as he is departed from God.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſcope of our Saviors coming is, to bring the Soul back again unto God, by himſelf, and to make it one with the Father and himſelf. It was beyond the power of any created Grace to bring back a fallen Soul; but the God-Head of Chriſt, in the Nature of man aſſumed, muſt bring the Nature of man to God again. And where as, it was found by proof in our firſt parents; that the power of created Grace did not, nay indeed could not, hold the Soul unchangeably to him, and ſo to act by, and for him.</p>
                  <p>Herein lies the life and incomparable excellency of the covenant of Grace, and the fulneſs of the ſufficiency of the quickning power of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus, not only to procure unto acceptance and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation with the Father, but the lively communication of himſelf, and the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit, <hi>to keep our hearts,</hi> and the gracious work thereof to him for ever.</p>
                  <p>So that, though our Graces might and would fall us in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet the ſpirit of Jeſus upholds and holds us for ever towards him, a fountain of living water. Though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66082:38"/>the vertue and work thereof would wanſe away, and through not-attendance, not put forth it ſelf upon the rule, and for the work, as we ſee in <hi>Adam,</hi> He attended not unto, acted not upon a command, but liſtened to the deluſion and ſuggeſtion of the enemy. Yet the ſpirit of Chriſt, which dwelleth with us, and ſhall be in us, is there, not only to keep with us and carry us to Chriſt, but to quicken us by vertue from Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenure of the Goſpel. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17. And this is indeed to be under the powerful impreſſion of the covenant of Grace. And this is the meaning of that place. I <hi>live not, but Chriſt lives in me. Gal.</hi> 3.20. Chriſt by Faith brings me to God. By his ſpirit keeps the bent of the heart towards him. carryes it to himſelf, acts it upon himſelf: quickens it by influence of vertue, the fountain whereof is in himſelf. <hi>Adam</hi> might have ſaid, <hi>I live,</hi> by a power and principle of Grace, in which I was created, and in which I have pleaſed God thereby, and according to a covenant of works may challenge life and happineſs. But <hi>Paul</hi> in the perſon of al ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners, profeſſeth that, <hi>I live not.</hi> Chriſt hath called me, brought me to himſelf; gives me his ſpirit, and keeps the Eye of my Soul upon himſelf: That he may thereby, <hi>Be all in all to me,</hi> work all in me and by me.</p>
                  <p>Its the meaning alſo of that. Col. 3.3, 4. <hi>Our life is bid with Chriſt in God: when Chriſt, who is our life ſhall appeare.</hi> God is in Chriſt, is in us: keeps us to himſelf, and communicates al ſaving Graces of life here, and will quicken and perfect all in the whol man at his reſurrection. Thus then we ſee, The end of our Saviors coming, and the life of the covenant of Grace; both theſe our Savior would further by his prayer:</p>
                  <p>But this unity with the Father and the Son; is the end of our Saviors coming, and the life of the Covenant.</p>

Its the meaning of that, Joh. 15.5. <hi>He that abideth in me, and</hi> I <hi>in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> True, it is done by faith: but it is ſomthing other, and ſomthing more, than the bare coming to Chriſt, or our Union with him. It is the keeping the Eye of the ſoul, and carrying the bent of the Heart upon the engagements of Gods deareſt love, and the unchangeable work of the ſpirit of Adoption to be acted by the quickning vertue thereof in Gods time, and after Gods manner, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to our need, and that condition and place we poſſeſs in the Body of Chriſt; for ſo that phraſe implieth. Joh. 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my Blood</hi> (that is done by beleeving) <hi>He abideth in me, and I in him.</hi> That is another and a further work; And it intimates a free and a ful intercourſe of ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between God and the ſoul: and a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his preſence and ſpiritual influence upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever.</p>
                  <p>As it is in the Body natural, when the conſtitution is healthful, and the compoſition of parts compleat and in a ſweet order, there is a free intercourſe of blood and ſpirits between each part, and in each paſſage, whence the whole is in perfect ſtrength, and each part active and able to its office. But when there grow obſtructions, the paſſages between part and part are ſtopped, the work is hindered, and the whole prejudiced, both in health and ſtrength. So it is, when this Oneneſs and this neer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the power and expreſſions of it, betwixt the Soul and the Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath his

As they are one with the Father and Chriſt; ſo are they wholly acted by them, and approve both their hearts and carriages unto them in all well pleaſing. So the Apoſtle, 1. Joh. 3.6. <hi>He that abideth in Chriſt, ſinneth not, but he that ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, nor known him.</hi>

                  <p>Thou ſeeſt here, what our Savior ſeeks for, ſues for, and that in thy behalf, and for thy good: yea when he would lay in for the relief of his ſervants, and provide for their comfort in this world, before he was to go into another world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When he would ſuit them with bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and good things, that might be ſerviceable for their everlaſting wellfare. This is the great and grand requeſt, and that put up in the firſt place, <hi>That they may be one in us.</hi>

                  <p>Go thy way, do thou likewiſe: pray thou likewiſe: Let this petition have the chief place in thy heart, and the firſt place in thy prayer.

                  <p>A pattern beyond all exception: we may, nay we ought, if we be wiſe-hearted, to imitate it. The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Savior is the ſtandard: by this we ſhould make al prayers, judg all. True, in every thing our prayers and ſupplications ought to be made known to God: What ever we would have, or have a ſanctified uſe of, ſeek it, and ſeek a bleſſing upon it; what ever we receive, be thankful for it. But, that which is of greateſt worth, we have moſt need of, and may receive moſt good by, affect that more than al the reſt, and ſeek that before all other.

                  <p>Set then this prayer of our Savior a Sampler dayly before thine Eyes, when thou comeſt to petition good things for thy ſelf, ſay; It is not the profiting of this world, that may inrich, not comforts, conveniences which might content, that I ſeek for. But, Oh that I, and al mine, and al thine, the families of thy ſervants and the aſſembly, may be, not one only in affection, but one in that neereſt relation of deareſt love, to thee bleſſed Father and bleſſed redeemer, That we might not live, but thou wouldeſt live in us, That we may be al one in thee.</p>

                  <p>We have here matter of unconceiveable comfort to ſupport the feeble ſpirit, and fetch up the fainting and drooping hearts of the poor and faithful ſervants of the Lord. What ever difficulty ye meet withal, that may diſmay you: what ever oppoſition from without, which

                  <p>What: that I! Such a ſinful and wretched creature? who am ſit to be cooped up with the damned, and chained up with the Devils, who have been one with them in al their wickedneſs: temptations have not been preſented, occaſions offered ſo ſoon, but Oh! this vile heart, hath been one, and ſided with them, and been carried by them, and tranſported with diſtempers, as with a violent ſtream.</p>
                  <p>What I can this carnal curſed heart ever be one with ſo holy and bleſſed a God? what! I! that have been a Traytor to the Lord Jeſus, and ſhed his Blood, and crucified again the Lord of life! I! who have been a Rebel againſt the Rich mercy and Grace of the Father, ſo graciouſly provided, ſo freely offered? that ever I ſhould imagine to be one with theſe, who have been an enemy to both? its beyond my thoughts, much more my Hopes, its not poſſible, therefore not credible. Why? alas, mine own experience wil give in evidence, and that undeniable, againſt my Soul. I have had all means, injoyed all ordinances, God hath tried all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, compaſſed me about with mercies, hedged me in with afflictions, to hold my heart to him, and keep me with him: All Hopes and helps have been plucked away, from whence I expected relief, that I might look to him, and be quickened and carried by him: Its not poſſible therefore to be attained. True, Its not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for al means to work: Nor poſſible by any power or ability of thine own to bring it about: And yet it is not poſſible, if the Lord Jeſus have prayed for it, but God ſhould give it, and you undoubtedly receive it from his Majeſties hands.

                  <p>Its ſeaſonable even for unbeleeving creatures (leaving ſecret things to Gods counſel) when they have no heart to pray, not Hope to expect any favor; and where ever they caſt their Eye, they find nothing but cauſe of diſcouragement and confuſion of face: look into the world, there is nothing but vanity there to deceive and vex, look they into their own hearts and lives, there is nothing, but Hells of ſin and guilt, which might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them; <hi>Look then to the Prayer of our Savior,</hi> who prayed for His in their worſt condition, when they did not beleeve, and could not pray for themſelves, and were as bad as I am: even for <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting and blaſpheming, even for many of the Jews, when they were killing of him, and why not for me? why may I not Hope the beſt, when I cannot conclude the worſt? what God wil do, he knows not: what he may do, he hath revealed, and I will yet expect.</p>

               </gap>y in way of order originally to act before another at the leaſt: And the other to act from him.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Father cannot act from the Son and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66082:43"/>Holy Ghoſt: but both Son and Holy Ghoſt, they do not act only, but act in their order and manner from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Son from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from both: therefore they are truly ſaid to be ſent.</p>
            <p>But if they look at the act only, which is expreſſed upon the creature, then this ſending is, and ought to be given to all the preſons. As the Incarnation of our Savior is one thing in his ſending. Therefore thoſe two are joined. God ſent his Son made of a Woman, as made, ſo ſent: and herein the Holy Ghoſt had a hand, whether we look at the ſanctification of the ſeed in the Womb, or the uniting of it to the ſecond perſon. There al the perſons work. So likewiſe in the diſpenſation of the office of our Savior, in his whol proceeding, the works of the Holy Ghoſt went along. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. The Spirit of God was upon me, he ſent me to preach, and he preached and performed all thoſe great works by the ſtrength and operation of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In what regard our Savior is ſaid to be ſent.</p>
            <p>Not as the ſecond perſon in the glorious Trinity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he is God bleſſed for ever, equal with the Father: for ſo the Apoſtle profeſſeth <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. Being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, <hi>i.e.</hi> Had the glory of the Deity truly appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and the God-Head dwelling in him, and knew his own worth and right; therefore willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to that Under-condition, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, for he wel underſtood what his due was.</p>
            <p>But as he was God and man, and aſſumed our Nature, and became mediator in our Room and ſtead. So he profeſſeth of himſelf: That his Father is greater than he. As he took upon him the forme of a ſervant, became our ſurety, and came in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, yet without ſin. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.28. In his voluntary and free diſpenſation, as he was willing to take our fleſh, and dwel thereby amongſt us, ſo is he inferiour to himſelf, as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66082:44"/>God, and ſo to his Father. And yet take the work it ſelf, and the manner of the work, as it was explicated before, and the phraſe of ſending implies; he is only ſent of the Father. But look at the work Earely, he may be ſaid to be ſent by all: but that is unuſual, nay in open phraſe never to be found in Scripture, becauſe the word comes not in that ſenſe to our view.</p>
            <p>As he becomes to take our Nature, ſo he was ſent. But as Son, by eternal generation, he is made fit to take our Nature. And therefore it is; the aſſuming of Human Nature is made a propriety, a thing peculiar to the ſecond perſon; Inſomuch, that it is hereſie to ſay, the Father was incarnate, or the Holy Ghoſt incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>What ever appertaines to our Savior, as the ſecond perſon, and as the Son of the Father; that he had by eternal generation, and in a peculiar manner from the Father. But as ſecond perſon, he aſſumes, and ſo is ſent, and diſpenſeth the work of our Redemption. Therefore ſo far he is in a peculiar manner ſent from the Father: and in this ſenſe, he is never ſaid to be ſent, but from the Father in the Verdict of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As he aſſumes and becomes incarnate, ſo is our Nature taken into perſonal union with the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo far is it advanced, and hath a priviledg and liberty to uſe any Attribute, ſo far he ſends the ſpirit, even the Holy Ghoſt from the Father, and diſpenſeth al power from the Father, by the ſpirit for the Good of his. And therefore ſo far he doth al in al, as he is ſent from the Father in a peculiar manner.</p>
            <p>In a word, hence it appears, that the work of incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he took our Nature, the work of diſpenſation in ſending the ſpirit, &amp; appointing al Officers, &amp; Offices &amp; ordinances, and accompanying and bleſſing all for good: Iſſues in a peculiar manner from this his ſending from the Father. Which the wicked world doth not ſee, will not acknowledg, cannot ſubmit unto, but they ſhal one day be forced unto it.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:66082:44"/>
            <p>Hence it is, our Savior alwaies profeſſeth, he doth al, as ſent. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.36. Arms himſelf by his ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt al. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.36. Looks wholly and only at that work, for which he was ſent. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.30. And generally all runs upon this ſtring, comforts all from his ſending. As my Father ſent me. So I ſend you; ſhews the greatneſs of their ſin, that oppoſe him, He that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wherein this ſending conſiſts: look at the work of it.</p>
            <p>Anſwer in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is appointed and ſet apart to this great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ambaſſage. Joh. 6.27. <hi>For him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> Jſa. 49.5. <hi>I have formed thee from the Womb, to be my ſervant, to bring</hi> Jacob <hi>again. And verſe,</hi> 6.—<hi>That thou maiſt be my Salvation to the end of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is now in Gods counſel and everlaſting decree deſigned to this ſo great a work, and in his ſeaſon called out to the execution, ſent from his Boſom abroad into this world, to act the great affaires of Gods everlaſting purpoſes, touching the recovery of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Father committed this ſo great a work unto his care and truſt, and laid it upon him as his charge, which by mutual conſent and convenant he willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook. Joh. 6.39. <hi>This is my Fathers will that hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe none, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> And therefore adds verſe, 40. <hi>He that beleeves in me. Shall have everlaſting life and</hi> I <hi>will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Yea he gives up his account of his work. John. 17.12. <hi>Thoſe that thou haſt given me, I have kept, and loſt none.</hi> And therefore compares himſelf to the good Shepherd, that layes down his ſelf for his Sheep. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gives him ful commiſſion for the accompliſhment of this work unto the ful, even as he is the Son of man;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66082:45"/>hath given right and liberty to the humane Nature of ours now received into perſonal union, to uſe and improve any of the Attributes of the Deity, for the further bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Saints, the good of his Church, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of thoſe ſpiritual ends, which may beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the glory of God, and the everlaſting wellfare of his people.</p>
            <p>This ſo wonderful a union doth advantage the Humane Nature to ſo high a priviledg, to uſe al the excellencies of the Deity, at al times, anſwerable to al neceſſities, to fetch ſupply ſuitable, to the wants, deſires, comforts of the Saints. This is the meaning of thoſe places. Math. 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> To have al power, it to be Omnipotent, for more than all cannot be conceived no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> poſſeſſed: more than that, God hath not: and that becauſe it is an in-communicable Attribute, he cannot communicate: but the meaning is; though it be not omnipotent, yet it hath liberty to ſet that on work, for the benefit and beſt good of Gods ſervants.</p>
            <p>Hence, what the Father doth, the ſon is ſaid to do alſo. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the ſon to have life in himſelf.</hi> Verſe, 19. What ever things he doth, thoſe the ſon doth likewiſe: for as the Father raiſeth up the dead, even ſo he. Joh. 17.2. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all Fleſh, to give unto them eternal life.</hi> He that muſt reſcue them from Hel, and ſin, and death, and from divine Juſtice, he muſt have power over al: That the power in Heaven, may not prejudice and fruſtrate the work: in Hel hinder it: on earth oppoſe it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Father leaves the immediate diſpenſation of al the work unto him, to act it, according to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For ſo our Savior, <hi>As the Father raiſeth, and quickeneth, ſo the ſon quickeneth whom he will.</hi> Joh. 5.21: And adds verſe, 22. <hi>For the Father judgeth no
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66082:45"/>man: but hath committed al judgment to the ſon.</hi> Not that the Father hath not power for the execution of the work. For he that gives it, hath it in a principal and ſoveraign manner. But he hath committed the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate execution thereof unto the Lord Jeſus, and ſo of the whol work of our Redemption. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27. That (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he appointed him next unto himſelf in the kingdom of Egipt Gen. 41.40,44. I <hi>am</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and without thee, ſhall no man lift up his hand or foot</hi>) no man ſhal do any thing, which way ſo ever he turn himſelf &amp;c. Only I am <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> So the Father to Chriſt, he delegates the execution of al in Heaven and Earth unto him, only he is greater. This is the meaning of that place. 1 Cor. 11.3. <hi>I would have you know, that the Head of every man is Chriſt, the head of the Woman is the man, and the head of Chriſt is God.</hi> Whence know,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtle ſpeaks not only of faithful men and Women, but of al men and Women according to their ſex. For the ſcope is to ſhew that Women ſhould be ſubject, not only gracious, but al. And this he ſhews from the feebleneſs and underneſs of their Nature and ſex.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That theſe different degrees of excellency are only to be attended in regard of ſubordination, in order one to another, and immediate diſpenſation from one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; for that Head implies, not only excellency and dignity, in the general, but power to move al, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ord nation to it; authority to rule all in ſubjection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:66082:46"/>
            <p>But the Apoſtles meaning and intent was, to ſhew, the orderly and next diſpenſation in the ſeveral degrees: the immediate influence and diſpenſation of power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the ruling of the femal ſex, is in a way of providence and appointment from man: the immediate diſpenſation of power to man is from Chriſt: to Chriſt from God the Father, who hath ſent him. And thus Chriſt is, and doth to al: only diſtinguiſhing the manner and end of his diſpenſation, To the wicked in way of Juſtice, for their ruine and deſtruction: To the godly in way of mercy for their ſpiritual good. That's the meaning of that, <hi>All is yours &amp;c.</hi> And hence the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28. Chriſt is ſaid (when he hath conquered al enemies, the laſt is death; damned all the wicked and delivered up is Children into the hands of his Father) he then is ſaid: <hi>To deliver up his Kingdom to the Father, i.e.</hi> Only in regard of this outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. For then God the Father ſhal, in and through Chriſt, communicate himſelf to all his Saints.</p>

               <p>The Traveiler paſſeth by many countries, baits at many places but he takes not up his abode and reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come to his own Country and own home, and there he ſtayes: That ſhews he is that Country man.</p>

But when theſe poiſes are plucked away: mark what thy Soul before deſired inwardly, what it now wil into of it ſelf: If to the world, and the vanities thereof, thou art a worldly man to this day. Hence it is, that many in theſe places drop away, and fall hand-pat to the world, after a long profeſſion of a heavenly life.

Coloſſ. 3.1. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek the things that are above,</hi> ye ought to do ſo, and ye will do ſo. The Apoſtle Iſſues both the parts, with the grounds of them. 1 Cor. 15. 48. <hi>The firſt</hi> Adam <hi>is from the Earth, earthly: the ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>is the Lord from Heaven: As we have born the image of the earthly, ſo ſhal we bear the image of the Heavenly.</hi> Yea our Savior concludes it, <hi>They are not of this world, as I am not of the world.</hi> As he by the power of his God-Head, took our Nature to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the power of the fame God-Head, he takes our Souls to himſelf, carries them to himſelf, acts them upon himſelf, keeps them with himſelf.</p>

But this cannot be meant in this place.</p>
            <p>For that glory is here meant, which is given by our Savior, unto his faithful ones.</p>
            <p>But the glory which is the Prerogative of the Deity, he profeſſeth, he will not give unto another. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. Therefore this is not intended.</p>

            <p>The Glaſs is the Lord Chriſt, in whom the Glory of the Grace of God is imprinted, and by whom, and through whom, it is diſpenſed and communicated to us, that we not only receive, but increaſe in this Glorious Grace from one degree thereof unto another; And that by the Holy Spirit of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Both theſe are here underſtood: Grace in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and that eſpecially and Firſtly: yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the perfection of it, For our Savior ſpeaks of it, as a thing certain to himſelf, and that which wil aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo accrew to his, nay which they have now in the kind of it.</p>
            <p>Hence, before we paſs; we may learn how to <hi>judg</hi> of true <hi>Glory,</hi> and how to <hi>attain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 How to <hi>judg</hi> of true Glory, that which wil go for currant in the Court of Heaven, and in the account of the Almighty; to-wit.</p>
            <p>Its not what the folly of mens minds doth conceit, or the breath of the world would advance, or the pride and ignorance of the moſt do take and admire as glorious, that wil indeed give in evidence ſufficient to paſs a righteous Sentence in this behalf.</p>
            <p>Its not the wealth and riches of the world, be they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66082:54"/>never ſo great, revenues never ſo fair and beautiful; though thy friends, alliance and acquaintance be never ſo many and high, wil ad any glory to thee in truth, or in the account of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If thou haſt a baſe heart, leadeſt a graceleſs life, thou art a baſe man, and a baſe woman. Thy Favourites may flatter thee, and friends applaud thee, and thy neighbors ſpeak wel of thee: but thou art abhorred of the Lord, art loathed of the Saints, that can tel how to judg. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. If thou beeſt a wicked man, a vicious, proud, ſtubborn, froward perſon, truly thou art <hi>a vile perſon;</hi> and it a note of him, that wil enter into God Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and dwel in his Holy Hil, that he ſhould deſpiſe thee as ſuch: though thou hadſt never ſo much of al this earthly pomp the world can afford.

The froward in ſpirit is abomination unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>Nay though thy place and priviledges be never ſo high and great, they indeed may be glorious, as having ſome impreſſion of Gods power and authority painted upon them, but yet, if thy heart be void of Grace, and thy life of Holineſs; Thou art wholly deſtitute of any true glory.

Do not catch at a ſhadow, but get the body, and that wil not fade away: do not thing to keep the light in the room and ſhut out the Sun-beames, or let the candle be carried away.</p>
            <p>Be truly vertuous, and it cannot be but glory wil be thy companion; and that in the very conſciences of the wicked, though their mouthes, it may be, wil be-ly their Conſciences for to maintain their own wayes.

            </p>
            <p>Would ye therefore pray more excellently, hear more excellently, confer more excellently, than al the carnal men in the world? get this Precious Faith, then ye wil be Precious Chriſtians, and have precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How our Savior received this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He received this Grace as man, not as God, or as the ſecond perſon properly, for ſo he is equal to the Father, and hath equal propriety in al the Attributes of the God-Head. Beſides, the Grace here is that which is given to beleevers: but ſo that cannot be.</p>
            <p>He receives it therefore as man and that by gift, ſaith the Text, for our Savior acknowledgeth it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is <hi>Given</hi> by the Grace of perſonal Union, in that it pleaſed God the Father, that the ſecond perſon, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſon, ſhould take our Nature into perſonal Union, ſo that though he was a perfect perſon before that was aſſumed, yet he remained one and the ſame perſon after it was aſſumed; there he two Natures, but one perſon ſtill.</p>
            <p>Thus the Apoſtle diſputes, and the connection im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes ſo much. Col. 1.15. <hi>He is the image of the Inviſible God</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> as ſecond perſon,) <hi>and ſo in him all things conſiſt;</hi> and by him al created: and he is the Head of the Body, the Church and the Iſſue of al is, <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwel. i.e.</hi> al the fullneſs of al Grace is in Chriſt, in that he is Head, and ſo head, as that he is alſo the inviſible image of the Father. In a word,</p>
            <p>Look what the Human Nature did receive from the Son, as a Son, and begotten of the Father, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by gift alſo and firſtly from the Father, becauſe what the Son doth, as Son, he doth it from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:66082:55"/>
            <p>But the Human Nature received it, as the higheſt gift, that ever was given, to be taken into perſonal union by the Son, as the ſecond perſon begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>What the Son, as the Son, begotten of the Father gives to the human Nature, that the Father gives firſtly.</p>
            <p>But this perſonal union, the Son, as from the Father, gives: Therefore the Father gives it firſtly. Upon this ground is that Inference alſo or the Apoſtle. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, 10. The Apoſtle would have them walk in Chriſt, in the power of his Grace, and in the direction of his rule and government and he joyns theſe two together, as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>For in him dwels the fullneſs of the God-Head Bodily,</hi> Nor by way of type, but truly, nor yet by communication of vertue, which he doth to and in the Saints, nor yet by ſacramental relation, as he doth accompany his ordinances, but the very eſſence of the God-Head in the ſecond perſon ſupports the Human Nature, as one perſon with it. This is the Union. verſe, 10. <hi>Ye are complete in him, who is the Head &amp;c.</hi> Compleat in al-Grace, to inable in al the fulneſs of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="1">1. Our Savior hath received <hi>Al</hi> moſt glorious Grace in a moſt <hi>Eminent Manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Grace is firſt in his Human Nature: For ſince the fal, and that <hi>Adam,</hi> through his juſt deſert, hath deprived him of the Grace, that God had given him in Innocency: Had not our Savior taken our Nature into union with himſelf; that in it he might ſuffer and ſatisfie and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Gods Favor and ſpirit to bring us again: It had not been poſſible, that ever any grace ſhould have been imparted to us.</p>
            <p>He is the <hi>Head of his Church.</hi> Eph. 1: 22. <hi>The Root or Stock</hi> unto the Scions and Branches. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1.</p>
            <p>The fountain of living Water, al means, and men, and ordinances, are but conduits, which give no more than they do receive: As the Moon from the Sun: as the looking Glaſs reflects the light, hath no light. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. To give the light of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath it OUT OF MEASURE, not only becauſe he hath the ſpirit of Grace dwelling in him, with the God-Head: and all the fulneſs of the God-Head: But alſo, He hath al Graces, in al the Kinds of them, and all the degrees.</p>
            <p>As there is no weakneſs attending any Grace, which ought to be removed: there is not any Scantneſs that any more can be added; nothing but wiſedom, no folly, or ignorance to blemiſh it, and there is ſo much, that Human Nature is capable of no more, no further increaſe can be expected.</p>
            <p>In the Body of Chriſt, and amongſt al Chriſtians, each man hath his meaſure and proportion ſuitable to his place, and anſwerable to the condition he doth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in the Body.</p>
            <p>As in the Body natural: The finger is not ſo big as the hand, nor that, as the Arm', nor that as the Back or Thighs: but each holds his place and proportion, and ſo his perfection in his kind. So in the Body myſtical:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66082:56"/>one excels in patience and Meekneſs, though truly Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: another excels in Zeal and courage, though meek and humble in his meaſure alſo. Some are hands, and ſome are fingers and feet in this myſtical Body, and all the while, the proportion of their Graces anſwer their places; Its comly.</p>
            <p>But its otherwiſe with our Savior. He is Zealous, and meek, and patient and nothing can be added to the meaſure, fulneſs, and perfection of theſe. Eph. 4.13. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the meaſure of the ſtature &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Without ALTERATION, or poſſibility of looſing, weakening or decaying in the power of any Grace.</hi> This was incident, as we find by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the ſtate and perfection of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency. He came compleatly furniſhed with all abilities, which might anſwer his condition, and the obtaining of his end. His underſtanding and knowledg clear; and yet became firſt to be darkned, then deluded, and then loſt and taken away from him. His will holy, and fitted to chooſe and to injoy the chiefeſt good, but immediately unſetled and perverted: and corruption defaceth the whol man.</p>
            <p>But it is beyond al poſſibility, that the leaſt decaying in any of theſe glorious Graces, ſhould betide him: becauſe our Human Nature is not vertually only, as to <hi>Adam,</hi> but the Eſſence by the perſon comes to be knit in perſonal Union with it, and ſo ſuſtaines it in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable condition. For if our ſavior ſhould be changed, the infinite power of the Spirit of the God-Head might be over-come, and put to the worſe, which is impoſſible. It was an argument to them, for their ſafety, that they ſhould overcome the world: becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. Therefore much more in our Savior eſſentially, when in us vertually. The Prince of this world comes, ſaies our Savior, and finds nothing in me; Finds no ſin that he can provoke, &amp; ſo taketh an advantage, nor finds he weakneſs or muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any Grace, that he is beyond all Hope to ſhake.</p>

So it is not with any man. He may exerciſe and put forth the act of Grace upon another, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of his own Grace to another, to make him wiſe by anothers wiſedom, this cannot be. Joh. 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs we all receive.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.23. The Church is ſaid, to be <hi>the fulneſs of him, that filleth all in all.

               <p>We may hence diſcover, whether our Graces be counterfeit or of the right kind, ſuch as a man may be content to appear before Chirſt withal, ſuch as will go in Heaven with us.</p>
               <p>All Graces are firſtly in him, as the treaſurer of all Graces: therefore ours muſt be from him, if they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor any thing of Chriſt, or we expect any acceptation for them. So Paul. 2 Cor. 13.3. <hi>Since ye ſeek a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking:</hi> So we ſhould ſeek a proof of Chriſt humbling, of Chriſt making us patient, and meek, and Zealous. For there be counterfeits of al theſe, which carry a great ſhew and appearence to thoſe that have no skil in mettalls, and carry not the Touch-ſtone of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning about them. Ask therefore this, whence come thy Graces; If they be of the right make, they came from the right mint or quarry.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> iſſues it. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Prove and examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith or no. And how is that done? know ye not that Chriſt is in you, unleſs ye be reprobates: al is droſſy otherwiſe. <hi>Splendida peccata.</hi> Prove that, and the other wil be apparent. As we ſay of <hi>China</hi> Mettal. If it be right, its only there found, and muſt from thence be fetched. There is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66082:57"/>counterfeit and falſe, that is meerly imitated. So it is, If ſaving Chriſtian Grace, they muſt be from a Savior and a Chriſt. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> intimates and points out ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, by way of diſtinction. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.2.</p>

               <head>REASONS.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Taken from the proportion between the firſt, and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Type and the Truth. As the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> conveyed his ſin and wrath by a covenant of works: the ſecond muſt convey holineſs and life by a covenant of Grace, and the free gift thereof. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> begat a Son in his own image, wholly defiled and defaced with original corruption, and ſo made him Heir apparent to the curſe and condemnation thereby. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> muſt inſtamp the image of holineſs upon his, without which, none ſhal ſee life. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.14. Thus the Apoſtle diſputes, 1 Cor. 15.49. <hi>As we have born the image of the Earthy, the firſt, ſo we ſhal bear the image of the Heavenly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For this end, the human Nature of our Savior hath received, and is become the firſt ſubject of al Grace, that from thence it might be derived unto the Nature of his Children. For this end, in our Nature he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med what ever divine Juſtice hath required, purchaſed, and provided a way and means for the communication of al Grace to his: Therefore undoubtedly he wil give it, and they receive it: Otherwiſe, he ſhould miſs his end, and they their good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For this end he hath received al Grace. For had not the ſecond perſon, by the power of the Deity, brought our Nature to God, and aſſumed it into perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al union with himſelf, ſo that the fulneſs of the God-Head might dwel Bodily in it, and ſo the fulneſs of al Grace communicated thereunto: It had not been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ever the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who are become ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and the work of his Grace, ſhould have been made partakers thereof, being wholly croſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Col. 2.10. <hi>Ye are complete in Chriſt, becauſe in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God-Head Bodily.</hi> Ye need no other King to rule, nor Prophet to teach, nor Prieſt to ſanctifie.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66082:61"/>
               <p>Yea for this end in our Nature he hath purchaſed al, provided a way to convey al Grace.</p>
               <p>For had he not died, and by death ſatisfied the Law' the ſtrength of ſin had never been ſubdued, nor could our corruptions be mortified.</p>
               <p>Had he not by his reſurrection triumphed over the power of Grave and Satan, and al ſinful weakneſſes, we had never had our hearts raiſed and quickned to Newneſs of life.</p>
               <p>But when he died, we by his death, dy to ſin: and ſin died when he roſe: we by his reſurrection muſt riſe to Newneſs of life. For this end, theſe were performed, and this muſt alſo be attained. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. Therefore it is, that this gift of Grace is committed to him, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and immediate communication belongs to him. Therefore the Spirit is ſaid to take of Chriſts. Joh. 16.14. <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> There is no killing vertue, quickening ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, could be applied or received, but only through his death, firſt in him, thereby, then in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that gives the faithful, the Spirit of Grace and glory, muſt needs alſo give them all glorious Grace.</p>
               <p>But our Savior doth ſo. This is the reaſon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle alledgeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. As by the ſpirit of the Lord. Rom. 8.2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life hath freed us from the Law of ſin.</hi> As it is in the Scion knit unto the ſtock, It is partaker of the ſame ſap with the ſtock: So here. They are ſaid to be implanted into the ſimilitude, <hi>i.e.</hi> To grow up together in the ſimilitude of his death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. As his ſpirit by his death killed ſin, that was charged upon him: So we by that Spirit, grow up in the vertue of that death, and die to ſin.</p>

The Spirit takes of Chriſt, before he gives it to us: therefore much more we muſt go to him, before we can receive it. <hi>The way lies in theſe four things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>See all in him,</hi> And Joyn none with him, as the Author and worker of this. There be inſtruments to convey Grace, but there is no Author of this, or giver of this, but Chriſt. <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive.</hi> All
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66082:63"/>other things are empty without him, and can work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further than he will work by them. Chriſt is al in al. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. Not ordinances, not Duties, not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: <hi>Paul</hi> is nothing, <hi>Apollo</hi> is nothing, but Chriſt is all, Chriſt by all, Chriſt through all theſe works.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look at that in Chriſt, which we need and would have, and keep the heart under the ſtroke of the Spirit in Chriſt, that working Grace in the Nature of our Savior, from thence he may work Grace in us. If we would have patience, Eye the patience of Chriſt, and the Spirit working patience in him, and from his patience, patience in me. As it is in a Glaſs that hath many colors, Red, Green, Blew, Yellow; If the Sun ſhine upon it, it wil convey the like colors upon that which is oppoſite to it. The Human Nature of our Savior is as the Glafs, all the Graces in their variety are like ſo many colors: The Spirit ſhining upon the Nature of our Savior by it leaves the like impreſſion of Graces upon our Souls, while by faith we keep our Hearts under the ſtroke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith acts each faculty to diſgeſt and improve that power from Chriſt received, for his particular uſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its particular end. As the Veines deliver up the Blood to each part, as that ſpecial portion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which is allowed in the courſe of Nature, for its relief, and ſo each part taking the Blood, it doth appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate it to its own Nature. Bone makes Bone of it, Sinews make Sinews, &amp;c. So Faith, like thoſe Veins, conveys the efficacy of the Blood and merits of Chriſt to all the faculties, to anſwer al their neceſſities.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt wait Gods leaſure, and ſtay his time for the beſtowing of his favors. Beggers muſt not be Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; And nothing more free than gift: And therefore he that will challenge it, at his time, and according to his wil, makes it a Debt, and not a Gift.</p>

               <p>Here is the third thing, that was eſpecially intended in the verſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. We heard that Chriſt had all glorious Grace given him.</item>

                  <hi>Here laſtly we have the</hi> END AND AIME <hi>of our Savior, in this his bounty in giving, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the faithful in receiving.</hi> Viz. <hi>That they may be one in the Father and the Son.</hi> Hence,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>The end why the Saints receive all glorious Grace from our Savior Chriſt, is this,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> that they may be one, as the Father and Son are one with themſelves.</head>
               <p>This is a truth not included, or that which may by way of conſequence be collected, or probably inferred out of the text: But that which is clearely intended, as the chief ſcope of our Savior, yea fully and plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the words, beyond all exception or diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which carries ſuch evidence out of the phraſe of ſpeech, that unleſs a man wil caſt away the rule and dictate of right reaſon, he can in no wiſe reject or refuſe.</p>
               <p>Ask but the Queſtion, why did our Savior Chriſt receive all glorious Grace into his Human Nature from God the Father?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, He received it by way of gift, that he might give it to others out of his faithfulneſs. He was their Treaſurer.</p>
               <p>But aſcend one ſtair higher, if yet further we may ſtirr. What was the end of our Saviors giving of this Grace?</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:66082:64"/>
               <p>The Anſwer is ful and fair from the letter of the text, for this is another reaſon, that can be faſtened upon the manner of the ſpeech, It was for this end; its that which our Savior aimed at in a peculiar manner, <hi>That they may be one, as the Father and Son are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Crown of that glory, which the Saints ſhal attain in the ful perfection thereof in Heaven, yea the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of that Crown, the Pinnacle and higheſt point of perfection, there to be expected in regard of their own particulars; as that which each man hath in his Eye. The Heaven of Heaven, and one ſtep higher than the higheſt Star of glorious Grace.</p>
               <p>For we know the end is better than the meanes, and adds beauty to the meanes, Els there would be a flaw and blemiſh in glory, and ſome defect. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. When all the Churches are perfected and the Saints ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and come to the fulneſs of the Stature of Chriſt, and have attained the unity of the faith. The higheſt ſtrain of their happineſs is, to acknowledg the Son of God. <hi>q. d.</hi> There is nothing to do in Heaven, but only that. That's the top of glory, and one ſtep higher than al the happineſs of al that glorious Grace, they ſhal injoy there to perfection: To give in witneſs through al Eternity, that al the good they have received, it was in Chriſt as the fountain: all that was done by al means, it was done by him. So the Apoſtle gives in the Reaſon of Gods diſpenſation, <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him, all fulneſs ſhould dwel; That in all things he might have the Preheminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tha Sacraments were ful of comfort and the word and Sermons ful of wiſedom, conſciences ful of peace that paſſeth underſtanding: but it was becauſe the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt overflowed in theſe &amp; filled theſe, otherwiſe had he withdrawn himſelf, the word had been a claſped Book and a killing letter, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> heart an empty Veſſel.</p>
               <p>So the Soul in glory, acknowledg no means, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66082:64"/>nor offices further than he appoints them, nor was there any power in them or vertue communicated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, further than the Lord was pleaſed to work by them. The power was Chriſt that ſtrengthened; The life and vertue Chriſt that quickened. The ſucceſs was Chriſts only, who was pleated to breath upon and bleſs.</p>
               <p>I take it to be the meaning of that place very difficult, and the expreſſion very ſpiritual and of a high ſtrain. 2 Theſſ. 1.12. <hi>That the Name of our Lord Jeſus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the Grace of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, you would ſay, Is there any Name higher than the Name of Chriſt, or glory due to any beyond or after Chriſt? why is it added, that Chriſt ſhould be glorified and you in him?</p>
               <p>For Anſwer, open the words a little, as we paſs for the preſent, we ſhall ſpeak more fully and largely, when we ſhall come to them again, that which may ſuffice for the while is this. The Apoſtle having prayed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe, That God would count them worthy of their calling, <hi>i. e.</hi> Worthy of the glory, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which they were called</hi> and ſo fulfil al the good pleaſure of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>i.e.</hi> fully beſtow al that ſpiritual good, which in the ful purpoſe of his good pleaſure he intended to them, and that he would bring the work of Faith to perfection by his mighty power.</p>
               <p>Now the end of al that glory and fulneſs of al that ſpiritual good he prayes for, for them, and they ſhould partake of, according to his prayer. The end of all is, that the Name of Chriſt (Chriſt as he is made known in his word and Offices and the execution of the great work of Redemption) may be made glorious in you; He from the Father giving al to you. You alſo may be glorified, not in your ſelves, but in your reference and Oneneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, in receiving and returning al to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him. And therefore thoſe words are added, according to the Grace of God, and our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66082:65"/>Chriſt: you ſo in him, as through him in God. God through Grace in Chriſt gives himſelf and Chriſt to you: you alſo through Grace give up your ſelves to Chriſt, and through him to God.</p>
               <p>For the opening, do three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Recal what this oneneſs is.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>How this oneneſs and glorious Grace differ each from other, or may be rightly diſcerned in their ſeveral conſiderations.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The Reaſons of the point, upon what grounds it may rightly be gathered and concluded: to be one with the Father and the Son is the</hi> END, <hi>and ſo of greater excellency, than al the glorious Grace the Saints do partake of.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. This unity, or oneneſs, is not the unity of affection, which the faithful, as members of the ſame body ought to maintain in their hearts, and conſciences, and convers; As being of one heart and mind; Keeping the unity of the faith in the bond of peace.</p>
               <p>For, Firſt. The expreſs words of verſ. 21. hold forth the contrary, and the latter looks another way. <hi>That they may be one in us.</hi> As though our Savior had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely added the interpretation of his prayer and words. <hi>q. d.</hi> If you ask me, of what unity I ſpeak, when I pray that beleevers ſhould be one: my intendment may moſt eaſily and fully be underſtood of this reſemblance, As I am in the Father, and the Father in me, the ſcope of my prayer is, they ſhould be one in us. The unity in themſelves wil ſurely follow, but thats not it I now ſo fully look at.</p>
               <p>Again the words of the verſe wil not admit this ſenſe. The glorious grace given to the Saints by Chriſt, is made here diſtinct from this Oneneſs; as the means is different from the end, and leſs excellent than the end.</p>
               <p>But unity of Affection is part of that glorious Grace,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66082:65"/>which our Savior hath given the faithful.</p>
               <p>So that it is the unity of relation. As the Father wholly and alone gives his being and Sonſhip to Chriſt: The Son, as he receives, ſo he returnes his being to the Father, as things in relation look each to the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and give conſiſtence one to the other, and ſo may be ſaid to be in each other, and to be one in this mutual reſpect. Joh. 14.10. <hi>Beleeveſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</hi> So here. As the Father is to Chriſt, looks only as a Father to a Son, and gives ſubſiſtence to him: The Son again looks, only to a Father, and returnes his being &amp; ſubſiſtence of a Son to him:</p>
               <p>So Chriſt to the faithful. He gives Spiritual being in Adoption to them, as his Sons only: They as Sons return al that ſpiritual being to him again. So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior; As I am one in them, and thou in me, and by ſpiritual influence communicate the being of Sons to them. So they are one in me, and to in thee, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and returning al alone unto us. So that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior doth not only bring the Soul of the faithful into the nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt relation of deareſt love as Adopted Sons; But alſo into that ſpiritual intercourſe of the peculiar and divine operation of God upon the Soul whereby the Soul returnes unto God, to do al, and receive al. To do all for himſelf in man: To receive al to himſelf by man.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus having fitted the Soul for himſelf, and united the Soul to himſelf, and made the Soul acceptable to the Father in his Blood. He ſends the ſpirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption into the hearts of his, ſets their hearts for God. Holds the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent of their hearts towards him.</p>
               <p>This is the gracious look of a Father towards them. The faithful receiving this ſpiritual being of Sonſhip, Faſten to Chriſt as the fountain of life: leave their hearts with him and abide in him, to be wholly acted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66082:66"/>by the influence and aſſiſtance of his Spirit, and to hold up the excellency thereof. Thus they return al to God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How this glorious Grace, which the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints upon the Soul, is diſtinguiſhed from this One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The words in the Text evidence the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: <hi>i. e.</hi> They differ, as the means appointed to an end are diſtinct from the end.</p>
               <p>This unity of relation carries the glorious operations or motions of the preſence of the Spirit upon the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Heart.</p>
               <p>I cal them Stirrings of his preſence, as implying that which is ſomwhat more general, than the gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ſpiritual and ſupernatural habits of Grace. For though thoſe alſo Iſſue from the operation of the ſpirit, yet they are ſomwhat more.</p>
               <p>As the Spirit aſſiſting, faſtening, holding the heart, and making it to abide under the ſtroke of the ſpirit, pacifying, quickening; Are not ſo much habits of Grace poured into the Soul, but rather Dints and ſtirrings of the Spirit aſſiſting or inhabiting.</p>
               <p>As he that ſets or Joints the part that is out, and chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it out of its numneſs, leaves a remembrance of the power and motion of his Hand: But he that puts in Oyl, leaves a quality or Oyly moiſture which remaines in the part.</p>
               <p>So here, The ſpirit draws, and unites the ſoul in vocation: leaves the poyſe of the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit upon it in Adoption; whereby it makes the ſoul abide in Chriſt and under the ſtroke of his ſpirit, as he abides in it.</p>
               <p>And hence follows the impreſſion of the image of God, the gracious habits of wiſedom, holineſs, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the wil, and ſo a liberty to ſpiritual good, whereby the beleever is inabled, not only to put forth acts of obedience and obſervance, which concern the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66082:66"/>works of the Law, but even to ſet a going, and that a freſh, thoſe ſeveral operations of the Spirit, unto which he had been formerly quickened by the vertue of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and carried unto by this covenant of Grace, as to faſten to Chriſt, to abide in him, and reſign it ſelf to be acted by him, and the power of his ſpirit and Grace. And this is indeed a thing of higheſt excellency, and therefore to this end and purpoſe the Choiceſt of all Graces ought in an eipecial manner to be improved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this appeares by theſe Reaſons following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That therein the glory of God, and his divine and unconceiveable excellencies are moſt magnified and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, for that end, even the glorious Graces in their higheſt pitch ought to be improved.</p>
               <p>But in this union of relation towards God, al the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellencies will moſt gloriouſly appear, and in truth much more than in al the gracious habits the Soul is capable of.</p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtle intimates (to my apprehenſion) with ſome evidence, as though he of purpoſe intended it, and would have al to underſtand it ſo. 2 Theſſ. 1.10. <hi>When the Lord ſhal come at the day of Judgment to render vengeance to thoſe that obey not the Goſpel,</hi> then ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>The Lord ſhal be glorified in his Saints but admired in thoſe that beleeve.</hi> True it is, that thoſe who are Saints do beleeve, but the Apoſtle ſeems ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to ſhew the odds, and this glorious excellency of the true Graces.</p>
               <p>They who are ſanctified and expreſs the power of Gods Grace in their hearts and lives: God wil be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them, that they do expreſs his vertues, and ſo ſet forth the glory of his Name.</p>
               <p>But when he comes to conſider of the bringing of a man to beleeve, here the work of God and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his dealing, is that which dazels the very Eyes of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66082:67"/>Angels, and amazeth the hearts of Devils. There his works are beyond all admiration.</p>
               <p>Admiration implies a thing not expected, or ſome thing more than we looked for, or lies open in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe, we wonder at ſuch a thing when it fals. And ſecondly we cannot tel what to make of it, or how to conceive or comprehend the Reaſon, its matter of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not of comprehenſion.</p>
               <p>When the Devil and wicked men knew ſuch men in their unbeleeving courſes, under the curſe of the Law and the power of their corruptions, contemners of Chriſt and mercy. The Devils have ſeen men holy and to walk unblameably; ſo in paradiſe; and therein God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and his vertues expreſſed: But when they ſhall ſee ſuch poor wretched creatures at Gods right hand. He was ſunk deep under the curſe of the Law, now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: under the Tyranny of Satan, and ſo in his Claws, he took him alive, now reſtored. In the bottom of Hel, now delivered. In death, and darkneſs now again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to life, and he that was ſo oppoſite to Chriſt, now brought ſo neer to him and the Father, and in them injoy the bleſſed and holy communion, which is beyond the happineſs of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Angels wil be ſwallowed with admiration, and the Devils confounded and aſtoniſhed, at the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the unconceivable compaſſion of the Lord, and the bleſſedneſs of this condition. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a living Soul, could by natural generation beget one like himſelf: But the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening ſpirit: That when dead, he can quicken them: when loſt, and oppoſite to him and Grace, he can and doth receive them to himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we look at our Savior meerly and only as the ſecond Perſon in the glorious. Trinity, God bleſſed for ever, not attending or conſidering his Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he filleth Heaven and Earth with his preſence, he then would have filled the hearts of the Sons of men in that manner, being preſent with them, as he is every where by his Omnipreſence:</p>
               <p>But the gracious &amp; ſpiritual expreſſion of his preſence had never been communicated to <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity: There was ſo great a diſtance, ſuch and ſo ſtrong oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition betwixt the corrupt and polluted nature of man, and the purity of the holy nature of the bleſſed God, that there was no poſſibility that ever there ſhould be, any agreement and communion, while man continued in that corrupt condition. <hi>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</hi> Am. 3.3. Much leſs dwel together. Yea the Lord profeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5, 4. <hi>Wickedneſs ſhal not dwel with him,</hi> much leſs he in it.

                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkneſs, Chriſt and Belial? that is, there is none, there can be none. Therefore we muſt look at Chriſt, as God-man, as he had taken our nature into union with him, and ſo in and by it, had made way for the communication of himſelf to his.</p>
               <p>By the nature of man he communicates his ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the Sons of men. By this, life is provided for the world of Gods elect. By this they come to be made partakers of it. John, 6.51. I <hi>am the liveing bread which came down from Heaven, If any man eat this bread, he ſhal live for ever.</hi> But the queſtion might have been what is that bread? he anſwers. The bread I wil give is my fleſh, which I wil give for the life of the world. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his humane nature is that mean, whereby life was purchaſed, and the conduit, by which it was conveyed to loſt man. And therefore he adds. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, ye have no life.</hi> And verſ. 56.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66082:70"/>
                  <hi>He that eateth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and</hi> I <hi>in him.</hi> So that there is no communion with Chriſt, no ſharing in his ſpiritual preſence and ſpecial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but by his fleſh.</p>
               <p>Chriſt, God and Man is our ſpiritual good, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he is not, nay cannot be digeſted for the ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of the faithful ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What kind of preſence this is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In the words of the doctrine, it is a <hi>ſpiritual preſence,</hi> not carnal or corporal; in ſo much, that the Apoſtle if he had known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet he knowes him no more after that manner. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. For the fleſh profits nothing, ſayes our Savior; the words I ſpeak, are ſpirit and life. <hi>John.</hi> 6.63.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, the bodily preſence of our Savior is not here attended according to the conceit of the Capernaites, and the Papiſts at this day: as though it were poſſible for the very fleſh of our Savior to be in al places, or in many places, according to the adminiſtrations of the ordinances, which ſignify or repreſent the ſame.</p>
               <p>Nor yet can the very fleſh of our Savior in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered be truly availeable to purchaſe any ſpiritual good or communicate any ſpiritual vertue.</p>
               <p>Yet this is certain and for ever to be obſerved, that the humane nature taken with the deity, and in vertue of the deity, puts forth a power in the expreſſion of his ſpritual preſence; whereof more anon.</p>
               <p>And the Lord Chriſt is thus ſpiritually preſent in his Church, as a head may be truly ſaid to be really and rven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in the body. For this is the office of our Savior and that in a proper and peculiar manner. He is ſaid to be the <hi>Head</hi> of his Church, neither the <hi>Father</hi> nor the Holy Ghoſt. The Father is the Father of the Church: and Holy Spirit the <hi>Comforte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r</hi> of the Church: but Chriſt hath this impropriate in him, that He is the <hi>Head.</hi> Eph. 4.15. <hi>Grow up in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Becauſe this appertaines to him, not as God onely, for then al the perſons had partaked thereof, as common: but as the ſecond perſon in the Trinity ſent of the Father working next in order from him, and as ſo ſent and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, terminating the ſame Nature upon himſelf, for the great work of our Redemption, and ſo he is head.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its proper to him to have al Grace firſtly in himſelf, in way and right of communication, for had he not been the ſon of man and ſon of God together, the way of Grace and life had been ſhut up from the ſons of <hi>Adam.

And to <hi>quicken whom he wil.</hi> Joh. 5.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The right and propriety of immediate diſpenſation is committed to his hand, of all Grace and good: <hi>Of his Grace we receive Grace for Grace.</hi> Joh. 1.16. And the Holy Spirit takes of his, not of his own, when he communicates to the Souls of the Saints. Joh. 16.14, 15. <hi>He ſhal ſhew you al things. He ſhal glorifie me, for he ſhal receive of mine. Al things that the Father hath are mine.</hi> Therefore ſaid I, He ſhal take of mine and ſhew it unto you.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66082:71"/>for the faithful, and enter into covenant with God the Father in their room, and purchaſe both Grace and glory in their behalf. For had he not taken the Nature of man, it had been unpoſſible he ſhould have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto man any good. So the Apoſtle reaſons, when he would ſhew the way how life came to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not unto Angels, gives this as the ground. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.16. <hi>For v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And being thus fitted for the place of a Surety, He did in ſpecial manner enter upon termes of agreement in the behalf of thoſe, he would do good unto; The happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe were committed to his care by the Father, and undertaken willingly by himſelf. Joh. 6.38, 39. <hi>This is the will of the Father, that thoſe that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe none, but raiſe them up at the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he is as careful to attend their ſpiritual welfare, as may be; therefore he concludes of them, in their times, and anſwerable to their conditions. <hi>I have other Sheep, and thoſe I muſt bring.</hi> Joh. 10.16. And when they are brought, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt away,</hi> nor ſuffer any to take them away. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having thus purchaſed Grace and glory for them, he hath now both right and liberty to improve al power in Heaven and Earth, to communicate Grace and glory to them.</p>
               <p>Yea the Human Nature of our Savior hath liberty &amp; power to let on work any, and all the Attributes in the behalf of the pooreſt beleever in the world: yea right to ſend the good Spirit of the Lord for his ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.

               <p>Hence by way of TRYAL, we way gain undoubted evidence unto our Hearts, that we are indeed Beleevers, and truly beloved of God and his Son: If once we find

This may be done by ſome other power, proceed from ſome other principle, than the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus. This is not a certain fruit of our union to Chriſt, or the inhabitation of the ſpirit of Jeſus in us. And in Iſſue, unleſs it lead neceſſarily to a Chriſt, or be derived infallibly from him, and the intereſt we have in covenant with him. Its no more than that a man may have, who hath no Grace: Its no more, but that which a man may do, that hath no part in a Savior.</p>
               <p>And hence, al ſuch evidences fal to the ground and utterly fail. And in truth, the weakneſs of expreſſions in this kind, men taking ſhews for ſubſtance, ſeemings and ſome appearances of things for the truth of things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, hath been the cauſe, that many have been couſened
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66082:74"/>with their own conceipts, and apprehenſions: many have denied all evidences, becauſe thoſe which they had and too much truſted unto, were fall, and failed them utterly at times of need. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt preſſeth this ſo inſtantly, and checks the failing in it ſo ſharply. 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Prove and examin your ſelves, whether ye be in the Faith or no,</hi> Acted by, and carried by the power of Faith.

               <p n="1">1. He that hath this preſence, hath ſomthing, and finds ſomthing above the bounds of al created abilities, that even the greateſt ſufficiency of the creature, the beſt indeavours and improvements of the beſt meanes in providence could reach unto, A wiſedom beyond all a mans Wit and readieſt ſubtilties and largeſt apprehenſions: a power beyond all the power of Nature, beyond what a mans abilities and dexterity can compaſs, education give, skil of art and ſciences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, practiſe and experience find out: beyond al the moral impreſſions, that the power of all meanes and help under Heaven can leave upon the Soul.</p>

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</note> even by the power of Chriſt. So the Apoſtle profeſſeth, He did not live, nor pray, nor preach. It was not abilities of nature which he had: not knowledg
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66082:74"/>of Art and learning, in which he excelled, by which he prayed: but it was the power and gracious preſence of the Holy Spirit of Chriſt, that acted and carried out al thoſe abilities, yea that ſpiritual power of grace he had to this work, either of praying or preaching. So 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>If any man require a teſtimony of Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in me.</hi> And therefore its the reaſon, which he gives, why the things of God are known by beleevers, and not known to the greateſt of the world. 1. Cor. 2.11. <hi>No man knowes the things of God, but the Spirit of God and we have not received the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit of God.</hi> Nay he comes yet lower, to the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the words: <hi>Which things we ſpeak, not in the words which mans wiſdome teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth.</hi> And the Saints often find, and profeſs it, they are helped and carried beyond al the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities they have, yea beyond al the power of al the grace they have. That look, as when we ſee a ſwadling Child left in his Cradle in a lower room, come againe, we find it laid in the higheſt loft or Chamber in the houſe, each man eaſily concludes: There was another power than that it had of it ſelf, that conveyed it thither.

Yet they ſet themſelves that way. Though they ſee; they are like Captives, and under the Tiranny of their diſtempers; they find, they do not: yea may be at ſuch an under, and in a forlorne condition, that they conclude, they are paſt Hope and expectation; never ſhal be recovered: yet their hearts bleſs them, that injoy that happy eſtate; and Oh that they might.

               <p>We have handled the firſt degree, attending the order of our Savior, who looks at them, as they appeare to us; and therefore ſo propounds them, as they may be moſt eaſily apprehended.</p>
               <p>We are now come to the firſt fountain and original, from whence this ſpiritual priviledg and unity hath his riſe diſpenſed and communicated, That is, from the <hi>In-being of the Father in Chriſt.</hi> This is the higheſt degree, further than which, we cannot aſcend. God the Father in Chriſt, and he in him: Chriſt in them, and

               <p>Hence two Points to diſcuſs.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Father is in the Son.</hi> Or, There is a mutual ſubſiſtence of the Father in the Son, and of the Son in the Father.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The Subſiſtence of the Father in the Son, in the firſt riſe, or Original; whence the Saints come to be one with the Son, and the Father.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt of theſe, we had it propounded by way of compariſon, to lay forth the manner of that oneneſs and unity, for which our Saviour here, praies the Saints might attain unto. And we then reſerved the ful handling of it unto this place: the words in the foregoing Verſe are ſo expreſs, as nothing more.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>As thou in me, and I in thee.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>And it is not for nothing that our Savior carries the thoughts of his Diſciples, and keeps them there in the ſetled, continual conſideration thereof, as if it were the hinge; upon which al happineſs and comfort doth hang, and therefore we ſhould ſtay in a kind of unmovable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance thereon.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> made that great requeſt unto our Lord Jeſus, as that which would give ſatisfying content, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond al exception; <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſhall ſuffice,</hi> John, 14.8.

A ready, and enlarged Communication of al good unto us: <hi>Whatever ye ask in my Name, that will I do.</hi> Shut up this paſſage, or turn aſide from attendance unto this Truth: dam up this Fountain, we dry up al the ſtream of Spiritual Power and Comfort, that would come into our ſouls.</p>
               <p>It is then a Foundation-Truth of the deepeſt ſearch, and that which hath a Store-houſe of Heavenly ſtrength, and refreſhing laid up in it.</p>
               <p>We ſhal open the Nature of it in three things.

                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>To the Firſt.</p>
               <p>The proper and peculiar Ground, from whence this In-being proceeds, may be expreſſed in two Concluſions, thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. This In-being of ſubſiſtence of the Father in the Son, &amp; of the Son in the Father, is not firſtly from the Eſſence, or Deity, conſidered according to it ſelf, or in it ſelf as ſome have conceived: As thus; Becauſe the Deity, or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which is in the Father, is in the Son, therefore the Father alſo is in the Son: for this is neither ſafe, nor ſound, but a dangerous miſtake; becauſe by the ſame reaſon, it may be concluded; That the Son is in himſelf, or the Father is in the Father. For the ſame Eſſence, or Deity (being but one) which is in the Father, is in the Son alſo; and then the reaſon would follow on like manner, thus: Where the Deity, or Eſſence of the God-head, which appertains to the Son, is, there is the Son.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66082:79"/>But the Deity of the Son, is in the Son. Therefore the Son is in the Son.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This In-being each in other, though it iſſues next<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and immediately from the perſons, yet not as they are in themſelves conſidered, without reſpect to the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but as they are ſubſiſtences in the ſame Eſſence, taking that in with them, to make up a ful, and compleat Ground; from whence this mutual ſubſiſting in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be inferred; as thus:
<list>
                     <item>1. Not only becauſe they have the ſame Eſſence.</item>
                     <item>2. Not becauſe they are diſtinct perſons alone.</item>
                  </list>
But becauſe they are diſtinct perſons ſubſiſting in other. For this mutual In-being requires both diſtinction and conjunction. They muſt be two, for one cannot be in it ſelf: and they muſt be together with the ſame Nature, or elſe they cannot be each in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As we ſee in the Creatures conſtantly, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Son; Buyer, and Seller: though they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Relation, yet becauſe they be in ſeveral Natures, ſeparate one from another, therefore they cannot be ſaid to be each in other. Thus for the Ground of this In-being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The ready way how to apprehend it,</hi> is made good in four Particulars.
<list>
                     <item>1. The ſame Eſſence of the God-head, doth equally, and indifferently in the whol Nature of it, belong to all the Perſons in the Deity: So that whatſoever is ſaid of one, may be affirmed of the other. They are al Eternal, al Infinite, al Omnipotent, Omniſcient, &amp;c. becauſe al God. As a man may be ſaid to teach himſelf, and ſo is a Maſter, and Scholler; a Maſter, as he teacheth; and a Scholler, as he is taught. Now the whol man is both, not a part of him a Scholler, a part of him a Teacher; but the whol Nature of Man bears up both Relations.</item>
                     <item>2. Hence the Perſons in the God-head, are diſtinct, truly amongſt themſelves, yet cannot be ſeparated, or divided one from another; but where-ever the God-head
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66082:80"/>is, they are, and where-ever one is, al are; becauſe the whol Eſſence is in every one, and every one with the whol Eſſence.</item>
                     <item>3. Subſiſtence of the Perſons, looks at the Eſſence, yet not as it is Eſſence barely, but as it is with the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Properties; and ſo thoſe Relative Properties by their Mutual Reſpect or Relation, give being each to other.</item>
                     <item>2. Subſiſtence looks at the Eſſence, as Eſſence, and ſo they attend upon, it adjoyn to it, and do accompany it, as the manner of the thing, doth the thing.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As the Subſiſtences, or Perſons, look at the Eſſence as Eſſence, upon which they do attend, and are adjoyned; ſo they are with the Eſſence, and one with another.</p>
               <p>As they look at the Eſſence, not as Eſſence, but as with his Relative Properties; as the Nature of Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and al things under Relation requires, they are then cauſes one of another, give being each to other, and are one in another.</p>
               <p>A word to both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As adjoined to the Eſſence; for ye have heard, that theſe Relations are not qualities inherent in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but attendants; and then I ſay, they are al with the ſame whol Eſſence, and ſo one with another. So Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.27. <hi>When he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Heavens, I was there, when he gave to the Son his decree,</hi> ver. 30. <hi>I was with him.</hi> John, 1.1. <hi>The Word with God,</hi> that is, the Father, <hi>and it was God,</hi> that is, had the Eſſence of the Deity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Subſiſtences look at the Eſſence with his Relative Properties, ſo in Relation each Perſon gives being each to another, and is one in another, <hi>John,</hi> 14.9. The Father dwels in Chriſt. That cannot in any propriety of ſpeech be ſaid of the Eſſence, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dwel in the God-head, becauſe they are Relations, and therefore no impreſſion in the ſubject. So, hence our Savior is ſaid to be in the boſom, and come from the Boſom of the Father. Hence he is ſaid, Joh. 10.15.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66082:80"/>
                  <hi>As the Father knowes me, even ſo I know the Father;</hi> Which Iſſues from this relation. For its that which appertaines to the Nature of Relates: becauſe they are mutual cauſes one of another: the knowledge of the one is the knowledg of the other. And this alſo ſeems to be the meaning of that. Joh. 10.30. I <hi>and my Father are one.</hi> The Jews they conceived, he blaſphemed, becauſe he made himſelf God. Verſe, 33. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or defends himſelf thus. <hi>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath ſent, that he blaſphemeth becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God?</hi> verſe, 36. And ſo the Argument may well ſtand, that they are one in relation and ſo one in another: for having ſaid, that none ſhall pluck his ſheep out of his hand, he gives this relation; becauſe the Father, who hath given them him, is greater than al, and none can pluck them out of his hand. If none can puck them out of my Fathers hand, then not out of mine: If my Father and I be one, then it follows: but we are one: One in this reference and relation one to another; and ſo in this action of ſending and being ſent, both as one, attend the accompliſhment of this work. We here want examples to Illuſtrate: becauſe the creature cannot afford in propreity of ſpeech, one eſſence to relation: yet a little to help, take that which is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar. As my hand is cloſing and cloſed: Theſe two as they look to the hand, are with it, and with one another. As they look to the hand cloſing. And ſo cloſed, cloſing and cloſed are cauſes each of other, and one in another. So in the deity: theſe properties of knowing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, like cloſing and being cloſed with it ſelf, as they look at the eſſence or God-Head, they are with it, and one with another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This ſubſiſting each in other is not an Individual relative porperty, but a notional reſpect, which attend al the relations of the perſons in common, &amp; therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make any diſtinct perſonality. But appertaines to al, and is and may be affirmed of al, as relatives giving being
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66082:81"/>each to other, they abide each in other. As the Scripture phraſe, the Father dwels in the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three Things for Explication: Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How this may be attended in our Savior, as God and man:</hi> for ſo he ſeems to ſpeak of himſelf in this place, in the ſeveral paſſages. For ſo he is in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: ſo he received glory, and gave glory. verſe, 22. So he was ſent. verſe, 18.</p>
               <p>In ſuch myſteries, that we may be wiſe unto ſobriety, and yet not ſlorthful; neither too curious, to ſearch more than we need, nor yet too careleſs, to neglect what God reveales: we ſhal ſtudy to walk in a ſafe path: and therefore I briefly anſwer generally, particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Generally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This In-being or ſubſiſtence in the Father belongs firſtly to the Son as ſecond perſon, and to the human Nature ſo far, as the relation of Sonſhip leaves ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and ſo alteration thereupon, according to the Nature and condition thereof. So that the ſecond perſon in the Trinity is no other, nor acts no otherwiſe than he did, in himſelf.</p>
               <p>But this manner of exiſting or acting appears in the Human Nature and leaves new impreſſions in a ſpecial manner, and the Father alſo in and by him: and that in a three-fold regard.</p>

                     </item>
                  </list> The Father his act in the ſon, and the ſon from the Father, diſcover new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions here, and all of them in a ſpecial manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe relations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſecond perſon takes the Human Nature into <hi>Perſonal</hi> UNION with himſelf: ſo that there are not two Sons, but one ſon: and therefore as the ſon is in the Father, the Human Nature, by the ſon, may be ſaid ſo to be, being one perſon with him. For as the Father gives being to the Son, and the ſon receiving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66082:81"/>his being unto the Father: So the Human Nature hath a total dependance upon the Son, and reference to him, and in him to the Father. And therefore as to be reflected is the property of the ſecond perſon, or looking back to the Father, or returning his ſubſiſtence: So our Nature in Chriſt, looks to Chriſt, having a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Chriſt, and being one perſon with him, looks as the ſecond perſon wholly to the Father. And whether the return of the Saints in God, and of al things in them, be not firſtly from hence, inquire, it wil do you no harm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of MISSION, The ſon in regard of this relation is ſaid to be ſent; that is a communication of work in order, from one to another, ſo as the ſecond perſon works from the Father, he originally from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The ſecond perſon takes the Human Nature into this order of Miſſion, So that al Grace is beſtowed upon it, and it is ſent upon commiſſion, in the Miſſion of the ſecond perſon, to which it is now united, to diſpenſe all Grace according to the will of the Father. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.15. All that the Father hath is mine.</p>
               <p>Thus he becomes the Head of the Church. For the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, ſent of the Father, works next in order from him.</p>
               <p>As ſo ſent and working, terminates the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon himſelf, for the great work of Redemption. And ſo its proper to him, bringing our Human Nature under the commiſſion offending, to have al Grace firſtly in way of right of communication. He being thus ſent, and having the commiſſion of al Grace, he is head of the Church, neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech. Thus ſaid to give him authority to Judg, becauſe he is the ſon of man. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27. That is becauſe he is taken into perſonal union and ſo under that commiſſion, as ſent from the Fathers as the ſecond perſon was. Thus uſually he ſhews authority. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20. The word, which you hear, is not mine, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66082:82"/>the Fathers which ſent me. And verſe, 26. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſends the comforter in the name of Chriſt; therefore the commiſſion was firſt his.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of OPERATION. For the ſecond perſon, in vertue of that his relation, he not only hath commiſſion from another, but works from another, and ſo executes the wil of the Father. And thus laſtly the ſecond perſon takes the Human Nature into this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to work al from the Father, and that the ſecond perſon doth, by vertue of this relation, and ſo of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of the Father in him. See the very ground given. Joh. 10.10. <hi>The word, I ſpeak is not mine, but the Father that dwels in me &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 8.38. <hi>For the works ſake, bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What ever the ſecond perſon, and Son of God, as ſuch, doth: that he doth by vertue of his eternal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Father, and from his abiding in him. But as Son he takes our Nature into perſonal union with himſelf and as Son advanceth it to that priviledg and liberty, to ſet al the Attributes on work, and to ſend the Holy Ghoſt, yea ſends al Officers, and appoints al Offices, and bleſſeth them.</p>
               <p>Therefore by vertue of this his eternal generation from the Father, and his abiding in him, this Union, Miſſion, and Operation of the Human Nature proceeds.</p>
               <p>The ſecond perſon, by this eternal generation from the Father, and abiding in him, is reflected upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as the Father hath an Eye only to the son, in giving the ſuſibſtence of a Son: the Son hath an Eye to the Father, in returning the ſubſiſtence of a ſon to him, they wholly give and take.</p>
               <p>So the Son, uniting the Human Nature into one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, holds it in reference and dependance with himſelf upon the Father. All is communicated to him as ſent,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66082:82"/>and ſo to the Human Nature: All acted by him, and ſo by the Human Nature.</p>

                  <hi>The In-being or exiſtence of the Father in the Son, is the firſt riſe, whence the unity of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with the Father and the Son comes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hither our Savior aſcends, and here he ſtaies, Leads us to the Well-Head, and fountain, whence our ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual wellface, and everlaſting good Iſſues. And this is the higheſt of al, and higher we cannot go; beyond this viſible world, and al creatures therein, even to Heaven, and in Heaven, above Angels to God, and in the God-Head, to the firſt original in the glorious and bleſſed Trinity, and the firſt act in that origination.</p>
               <p>To this accords that of the Apoſtle, each place adds mutual light unto the other. Col. 3.3. <hi>We are dead, and our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Chriſt is the Treaſurer, but the Father is the Author. Chriſt is the keeper, but the Father is the firſt Appointer thereof. For ſo you muſt underſtand the Name God, not eſſentially, but perſonally, being put in oppoſition and reference unto Chriſt, our life is hid with Chriſt, but Chriſt, and life, and al is in God, in the Father. Upon this ground it is, and to the like purpoſe, that the Apoſtle carries the hearts of the Corinthians in the work of their calling unto this conſideration, as that, wherein the loweſt part of the foundation of our comfort lies, 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God in made unto us wiſedom, righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> Chriſt is all, even complete Redemption, who delivers from the power and preſence of al evil, and gives all Grace: quickens what he gives, perfects what he quickens, owns what he perfects.</p>
               <p>But he is made this to us, not of himſelf, but of the Father, for ſo ſtil the word, and Name of God is to be taken, as appears, verſe, 24. <hi>Chriſt is the power of God, and the Wiſedom of God.</hi> Chriſt is made our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66082:83"/>Redemption, and we are made his redeemed ones, and the Father makes both, he our Redemption, and we his redeemed.</p>
               <p>And this is the cauſe, why the Apoſtle is ſo inlarged, inlaying for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Eph. 4.5, 6. <hi>There is one Lord Jeſus, one Faith, and one Baptiſme, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you al.</hi> Above al, even in the higheſt power that is diſpenſed in his Church; Chriſt is the Head and Husband, the Holy Spirit the comforter, God is the Father. Through al the operations and adminiſtrations that are in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Graces diſpenſed, He ſends his Son to the great work of our Redemption. God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelf. 2 Tim. 1.4. — <hi>Given us Grace in Chriſt Jeſus before the world was.</hi> He ſends the Spirit in the work of Application.

               <p>This unity, (as ye have heard) is not the Oneneſs of affection amongſt the Saints, but the Oneneſs of relation they have to God in Chriſt, as his Adopted ones. <hi>One</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> nor one with <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Oneneſs of Relation lies here, in that our Saviour doth not bring the Souls of the faithful in neereſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of deareſt love, as adopted Sons, but alſo into that ſpiritual intercourſe of peculiar and divine operation of God upon the Soul, whereby the Soul returnes unto God, to do al, and to take al.</p>

               <p>To receive all to himſelf by man, not man to take it, which was otherwiſe in the covenant of works.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus having fitted the Soul for himſelf, and united the Soul to himſelf, and made the Soul accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Father in his Blood. He ſends the ſpirit of Adoption into the hearts of his, ſets their hearts for God,

               <p n="2">2. <hi>How is this ſaid to be perfected?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall better underſtand this, if we a little conſider the imperfection of this Oneneſs, and wherein it appears: the ful removal of thoſe weakneſſes wil be the perfecting of this priviledg in our Souls.</p>
               <p>This imperfection lies in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the feebleneſs and unſoundneſs of our ſpirit when we do not abide in the Lord, we do out leave our ſelves under the power and ſtream of the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in and through which, al ſpiritual vertue is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, and the influence of the Spirit is conveyed unto us. But either we are crowded and thruſt off, by the ſtrength and violence of temptation, which as violent and boiſterous winds, and raging waves, force the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel out of the Channel, carries at upon the ſhore and ſhelves, where it is ſet on ground, if not ſplit.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſhock, the aſſault came ſo fierce, that it rowted his heart wholly: and <hi>David</hi> in haſt, faid, <hi>I ſhal one day periſh &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Or Els</hi> We go aſide willingly, through the folly and deceiveable
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66082:84"/>luſts of our carnal mind, which catch at every Twigg, hang upon every Hedg, rawm and reach after re ſet by our own devices. <hi>Will ye alſo go away? Joh.</hi> 6.67. Jonah hath a fetch of his own, and forlook his own mercies. <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.8. Somtimes out of ſinful diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements the Soul, like the Body in a fainting ſit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee his way, nor his Comfort, nor can it help it ſelf by holding that which is next at hand. Like a man wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in a dark night, and out of the way, he goes he knows not which way. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. <hi>My God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me.</hi> This comes thus to be helped, when God ſettles, and ſtakes down the ſoul, that it wil not go away, nor be carried away. <hi>O! intreat me nat to leave thee,</hi> Ruth 1. Aſhur <hi>ſhall not ſave us, but with thee, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs finds mercy,</hi> Hoſ. 14.3. When we grow up in Chriſt, as they, <hi>I will wait upon him, that hides his face from the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and will look upward, Iſa.</hi> 8.17. not inward, outward, downward, backward, when nothing from without moves us, nothing from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtirs us, or makes us turn back, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 18 as they, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16.17. <hi>We care not to anſwer, our God can, and if he pleaſe, he will;</hi> however, thither they look, and thence they wil not go.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is feebleneſs, we abide not, ſo there <hi>is croſsneſſ to the power of the Spirit,</hi> which gives not way thereunto. Though God through Chriſt let in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation to the ſoul, and our Savior put his hand into the hole of the door, and his fingers drop Mirrh, leaves ſweet inſinuations of his favor, preſent remembrances of himſelf, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.4. yet the ſoul is compoſing it ſelf to a ſecure ſluggiſh frame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3. <hi>My ſoul refuſed comfort.</hi> Ahaz <hi>will not ask a ſign,</hi> Iſa. 7.12.

               <p n="3">3. When by feebleneſs we abide not, by croſsneſs we cloſe not, or come to be fully ingrafted into the Promiſe. So laſtly,</p>
               <p>When the Soul <hi>will joyn any thing with Chriſt, or expect any Principle, or Power, to quicken, or carry our hearts, or abilities to any Service, beſide Chriſt,</hi> as ſharing with him in any quickening vertue, further than he appoints them, goes with them, works by them. This is a deſperate prejudice to the perfection of this Unity, and returning al to God in Chriſt. To lean upon Chriſt, and our own Wiſdom, expect from Chriſt, and our own Abilities, Ordinances, Offices, &amp;c. <hi>I am</hi> Pauls, <hi>and I am Chriſts,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.12. this is to joyn a ſtone and ſtaff together, and ſo we hold neither in our hand.</p>
               <p>This is perfected.</p>
               <p>When we come to eye nothing but Chriſt, to joyn nothing with him, expect nothing but from him, no ſtrength but from a Savior, but from Chriſt, who hath appointed it, ſanctified, and bleſſed it. <hi>Paul</hi> is nothing, <hi>Apollo</hi> is nothing, Word, Ordinances nothing; but Chriſt in them: they work nor further than Chriſt is in them, proſper not further than Chriſt bleſſeth them. A Sacrament may poyſon thee, as wel as nouriſh, if thou diſcerneſt not there, who is the Food of thy Soul. The
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66082:85"/>Word may be a ſavor of Death, as wel as of Life, if Chriſt breath not, bleſs not. Therefore al the Faculties ſhould faſten upon God in Chriſt, as Eagles upon their Prey, or as ſo many lines about the Centre, al meet him. Hopes expect Grace from God in Chriſt, and from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. Deſires long for mercy from God in Chriſt, and nothing elſe. As they, <hi>We will remember thy Name only. Jehoſaphat</hi> had al the Forces in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet ſtaies there. <hi>There is no ſtrength in us, our eyes are towards thee.</hi> When once it comes to that, <hi>we ſhall ſee him as be is, then we ſhall be like unto him,</hi> 1 John, 3.2. When we are ſetled ſo, that we ſtir not: yield ſo to al of Chriſt, that we oppoſe not; whatever this Spirit ſhall expreſs, we eye him only, and expect only what we need, and joyn nothing with him, or his excellency: then are we perfect in one. Abide perfectly in him, be acted perfectly by him, perfectly advance al the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of God, through Chriſt; then are we perfectly one with God the Father, in and through Chriſt. As the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>When be ſhall deliver up his Kingdom</hi> (that is, ceaſe the excecution of any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or Diſpenſation in an immediate manner by any Ordinance, or any Grace by any Ordinance) <hi>then the Father ſhall be all in all,</hi> inſtead of al Ordinances, Word, Sacraments, Sabbath, Prayers, Covenants, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; but the Father wil infinitly let out of himſelf to our Savior, and immediately through our Savior, unto the Souls of his.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The firſt reſpect: If we look at the Lord Jeſus as the Second Perſon, his Eternal Love then iſſues from his Eternal Generation. So himſelf ſpeaks, and confeſſes, verſe 24. <hi>Thou haſt loved me before the Foundation of the World,</hi> and ſo termed <hi>the only begotten, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved Son.</hi> And it ſhews it ſelf as the ſpecial operation of the moſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, and perfect Love doth, in three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Love affects Union, and where it can it attains it with moſt ſtrength. So it is here, after an unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, the Father is intimately endeared unto his Son, that his Eye is never off him, himſelf never from him. Therefore it is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. the Father is ſaid to poſſeſs him in the beginning of his way. He was all the proper poſſeſſion the Father had, and holds from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: and this is the meaning of that other Phraſe, verſe 30. <hi>I was with him, as one brought up with him.</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:66082:88"/>The Phraſe is marvelous ſweet and pregnant, as one nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up with him in his Boſom, and Bowels, from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. God the Father is compared to a Guardian of the Lord Jeſus, whom he keeps under his wing. I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the Father is ever with me; yea, the Father and I am one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's the Nature of Love, to take ful content, and complacence in the thing beloved: and ſo the Father doth in his Son, after an unſpeakable manner, takes an infinite fulneſs of ſoul-pleaſing ſatisfaction; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al Creatures were, he lacketh nothing, and he ſpent his whol thoughts in gazing upon the through concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of al unſpeakable excellencies in the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. <hi>I was dayly his delight.</hi> It was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and continued Exerciſe, the ful imployment of his bleſſed Majeſty, to fil himſelf with the fellowſhip, and familiarity of his Son.</p>
            <p>When the Atheiſt enquires what God did, before the World, if the World was not Eternal? Anſw. He was ſporting himſelf with the unconceivable complacency, and raviſhing contents of his wel-beloved Son, the Lord of Glory. So that nothing was wanting, while he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; nothing could be added, while he poſſeſſeth him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a Love of Benevolence. It's the Nature of Love to ſtudy the good of the thing beloved. This the Father doth alſo after an unconceivable manner. The ſtudy, and bent of his infinite Underſtanding, is now to plot for the Honor, and to lift up the Glory of his Son far beyond al praiſes. So that more than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave, could not be enjoyed, no more could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no more could be deſired by our Savior, when he would make his requeſt in that behalf. Hither the Lord Chriſt repairs, and here he takes up his ſtand, as though no more could be conceived, or communicated, <hi>John,</hi> 17.5. <hi>And now, O Father, glorifie me with thine own ſelf, with the glory I had with thee before the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66082:88"/>World was:</hi> q.d. If he was put to his choyce, to his deſire, or God the Father to his free giving, he could wiſh no other, nor no more glory, but that which he had with him from Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So the Father loves the Son, as Man, alſo in al the former particulars and in all the ſeveral properties of them, ſo far as a finite creature is, or can be made capable thereof, not only in regard of the compaſs of its own ability, but as far, as underpropped and ſupported by an almighty power. I ſhal point at the former ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in ſo many words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of union; here in the ſurpaſſing excellency of the love of the Father appeared, that he brought it into ſo neer a fellowſhip with himſelf, that it doth not only exceed al the power of the creature, to work ſuch a union, but even the reach of al reaſon of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to comprehend it. For not only the Eſſence of the Deity takes up its dwelling and abode there bodily, but its taken into the very ſubſiſtence of the ſecond perſon, and melts into the perſonality of the ſecond perſon: and hence it is, the Grace of union is indeed accounted a Grace of the greateſt excellency, above al other, and in truth it is ſo, not only in regard of the priviledg whereby our Human Nature is advanced one degree above the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the creatures of higheſt rank: for of that the place is meant, and that the Apoſtle intends, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.8 That al things are put in ſubjection to our Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt. <hi>He took not the ſeed of Angels, but of</hi> Abraham. When he bringeth his firſt born into the world, worſhip him, al the Angels, even as God-man but I ſay, not only in regard of the height or the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, this Grace of union is to be attended: But in regard of the unmatchable efficacy and Peerleſſneſs of power, that exceeds the bounds of my created ability: In that the ſubſiſtance it hath by this, is no other, but the ſubſiſtence of the ſecond perſon. In that the Angels
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66082:89"/>muſt ſit in a lower forme and aloof off, in the porch as it were, and adminiſter there, by their attendance, when our Human Nature is taken into the Chamber of preſence, the perſonal union with the Lord, and ſo conſequently, as thereby Co-partner of divine honor and worſhip together with the ſecond perſon. None of which can be ſaid of any creature, or any created Grace in the hearts of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Father takes ful ſatisfaction in the man Chriſt Jeſus. He proclaimes it openly. Math. 3. laſt <hi>This is my wel beloved Son, in whom I am wel pleaſed.</hi> He alone it is, in whom the Father ſmells a ſweet ſavor of reſt therefore when he caſhieres al other ſacrifices, as ſuch in whom there was no ſufficiency, our Savior no ſooner offers himſelf, but therein the Father quiets himſelf in fulneſs of content. Hebr. 10.5, 6. <hi>Burnt offerings, and ſacrifices thou wouldeſt not, then ſaid I, Loe I come, in the Volum of thy Book it is written of me, I ſhould do thy will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Improves the Soveraignty of his power and good pleaſure to promote the Son, and advance the glory of the man Chriſt Jeſus. Joh. 3.35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſends the comforter in his name. Joh. 14.26. Nay the Father makes this the maine ſcope of al his diſpenſations by Chriſt, puts the Adminiſtration of all things into his hand. That al may come to him, depend upon him, and give al glory to him, in what they do receive, and for what they ſeek, and hence the Father carries al the Trade this way. As great Princes when they wil advance their Favourites, there come no peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but by their hands; no kindneſſes or gifts, but by their meanes, That al may eye and honor, receive al from them, and by their means, and returne to them. Joh. 5.22. 25. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath commited all judgment to the Son, that all might honor the Son, as they honor the Father.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:66082:89"/>
               <p>REASON.</p>
               <p>Here are al the grounds upon which Love grows, and that in more than an ordinary Nature and meaſure, and theſe are three; all which are found in the Lord.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Neerneſs.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Likeneſs.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Suitableneſs of worth.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Neerneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that we ſee to be a forceable argument in Nature to draw men to inlargedneſs of affections. Love begins next home. A Countrey Man we affect, rather than a Forreiner; one of the ſame Town before a Countrey Man; a Kinſman before a Towns Man: a Child before him; the wife before others; a mans ſelf before al, wife and Children and Kinſman and Towns Man. So it is here.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus is moſt <hi>Neer</hi> to God the Father, and therefore moſt beloved. Its ſaid our Savior came from the Boſom of the Father. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Likeneſs is the Load-ſtone of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The In-let unto the hearts and affections of others, and cals out and requires a diſpoſition in another, like unto it ſelf. And this is here in greateſt eminency. Look we at the conſtitution of the perſon of our Savior, Hebr. 1.3. <hi>Called, the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon.</hi> Nothing is more like, than a lively Image, reſembling the Father, in the moſt perfect and infinite manner, none like him. Look at imitation, likeneſs in behavior, carriage, and converſation, is that which inlargeth affection alſo: and this alſo is here to be ſeen. Joh. 5.19. <hi>The Son doth nothing, but what
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66082:90"/>he ſeeth the Father do. For whatſoever the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is a ſuitableneſs of worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The beſt of our affection, and deſerve our deareſt love to be beſtowed upon it. So it is here. The Lord Chriſt, he being in the form of God, counted it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God the Father. And ſo there is an anſwerableneſs and proportion only here to be found between the affection and the thing here affected. Whereas al the creatures, taking in al their excellencies together, are too mean and under for the Lord once to beſtow his Love, yea his look upon (further than his own image is in them, or reſembled by them, in them) So the Prophet gives in the Jnventory of al their worth; <hi>All the Nations of the Earth are leſs than the Duſt of the balance, yea vanity, nothing, leſs than nothing.</hi> Chriſt himſelf it is, whoſe name is as an Oyntment pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and perfumes the world; which if once taken away, they would remain nothing diſireable.</p>

Only attend this, that ye may not miſtake the mind of our Savior, nor the meaning: It is but AS, for the quality, and likeneſs of this Love; not <hi>ſo much,</hi> as that it ſhould be equal for the quantity, and greatneſs of that Love, which was extended to our Savior, and to his Saints and Children: For that were to derogate from the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the Father, from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Excellency of our Savior, and to lift up both the Perſons and Priviledges of the Faithful, more than were meet and due.</p>

               <p>The like Phraſe we have again repeated in the laſt verſe of this Chapter, with which our Savior ends his Prayer, leaving that, as the laſt farewel, in which ſuch ſpiritual god things, and thoſe glorious Priviledges, that ever were promiſed, or could be expected or received, were ſummed up, even the marrow of al thoſe loving kindneſſes the Lord lets out unto his People; the taſt and relliſh whereof, if it were kept upon the Soul, it would keep a ſatisfing, and raviſhing content upon the heart of a Chriſtian in al Conditions; yea, carries him

               <p>But ſince the Fall of our firſt Parents, and departure from God, it was impoſſible for any Creature, or any created Grace, to bring back the ſoul to God; therefore the God-head of Chriſt dwelling in the Nature of Man aſſumed bodily, muſt bring the Nature of Man again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Man, out of the mutability of his Grace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from God; but neither man nor Grace, but the infinite Power of the God-head, muſt bring man to God again, and keep him with him. So that the Second Perſon in the Glorious Trinity, taking our Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, did not only purchaſe, by the power of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all for us; but by the ſame power, enables us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Work of his Spirit, by which he carries us unto himſelf, and the Father. So that it is not any created Principle of Grace, or gracious habit, which either fits us for Chriſt, or carries us to him, as we have heard. But the ſame Spirit by the ſame power that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, works it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20. <hi>No man comes, unleſs the Father draw.</hi> John, 6.44. <hi>He that hath heard, and learned of the Father comes,</hi> verſe 45. <hi>He it is that begets us again by the Word of Truth.</hi> Jam. 1.18.</p>

               <p>But beleevers are not in their own hands, nor at their own finding, but kept in the hand of Chriſt, and live
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66082:94"/>meerly and immediately upon dependance: have all their Store and Stock in the hand of the Lord Jeſus, are brought, and taken into fellowſhip with the Father, and his Son, and thence fetch al that dayly quickening, and efficacious influence of the Favor and preſence of the Lord, to carry them out to al the Duties they do. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live not, but Chriſt lives in me,</hi> and that I do now live. The Fountain of Life, is not firſtly in himſelf. <hi>Adam</hi> might have ſaid, I live by the Power and Principle of Grace received, and in which I was created, and thereby I have pleaſed God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of Works, may challenge life and happineſs.</p>

We are dead, and our Life is hid with Chriſt in God. Chriſt is the Keeper of our Life; the Father the Author of it.</p>
               <p>So that it is not any Power in Man, or Principle of Grace, whereby we come firſtly to cloſe with God: but the Spiritual Union of the Faithful, is of a higher or nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Nature, than that it can at the firſt readily be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; namely, not by the Power of Man, or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Grace; for al this is but a Creature, never brought the Soul to God, or kept it with him.</p>
               <p>But the power of the Deity in Chriſt, by his Spirit, hath fitted me for himſelf, and hath carried me to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, made me one Spirit with himſelf, doth al for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in me, that he may receive al to himſelf from me, and I might wholly have ſuch a deſire, that al that we have may hold out his Excellency in al theſe his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo have nothing of my ſelf, do nothing from my ſelf, which excludes Works wholly. Here the Soul is compaſſed about with al the Power of Heaven; nothing but with the power of God in Chriſt. Whereas <hi>Adam,</hi> who did ſomting of himſelf, from a Principle he had,

A little of our own, ſay we, gives to little content and reſt to their owner. A mans own houſe he delights to lodg in, delights to converſe with his own ſervants, or little ones.

So he that hath not the Spirit, is none of Chriſts; the Spirit which God the Father ſent in Chriſts Name, by that his are owned. As ſomtime a Parent, when the Child ſent into a far Country, and conceived to be loſt and dead, ſhall yet return, there is ſome manner of his Speech, ſome Natural guiſe in his Carriage, ſome caſt of his Look, whereby the Parent wil own him, and know him for his. As there was a ſecret owning, and yerning of Bowels in the true Mother to the Child, when it could not be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined whoſe it was. So God the Father, who hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into the hearts of his, he cannot but know, and acknowledg it, and take complacency, and contentment in it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. he is ſaid to <hi>know the meaning of his Spirit.</hi> Hence they are called; <hi>Gods precious ones,</hi> Iſai. 43.4. his <hi>Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3.17. yea, Chriſt profeſſeth, he is raviſhed with the caſt of the eye of the Spouſe, Cant. 4.9.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning may thus be conceived: The Apoſtle having prayed in the fore-going verſe, That God would count them worthy of their Calling, worthy of the Glory unto which they were called, and ſo fulfil al the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, that is, fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow al that Spiritual good, which is the ful purpoſe of his good pleaſure he intended to them, and that he would bring the Work of Faith to perfection by his mighty Power. Now the end of al that glory and fulneſs, of al that Spiritual good he praies for, and they ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take by vertue of his Prayer, is, <hi>That the Name of Chriſt,</hi> that is, Chriſt as he is made known in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in his Offices, and Execution of the great Work of Redemption, <hi>may be made glorious in you,</hi> who from the Father, hath given al to you: you alſo may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, not in your ſelves, but in your reference, and oneneſs with Chriſt. As God was made glorious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving al; ſo alſo in returning al to the Father by him: And therefore it's added, According to the Grace of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. God the Father, through Grace in Chriſt, gives himſelf, and Chriſt to you, ſo they are glorified in you receiving; you alſo through Grace, give up your ſelves to Chriſt, and through him to God, and return al to God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus he is ſaid to the <hi>admired in them that beleeve.</hi> So <hi>John,</hi> 3.27. The Father loves the Son, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven al things into his hands; and in Chriſt alſo, he hath

The Father looks to the Son in giving: The Son to the Father in returning his being. They are perfect in this, wholly give, wholly take. Thus they wholly delighted in each other, mutually glorified each other. Verſe, 2. Now as God in Chriſt thus begets and gives being of Sonſhip: So Chriſt as Son and ſecond perſon he ſo aſſumes: for had he aſſumed as God, all had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. But he aſſumes perſon, and to ſay, that any perſon aſſumes, but the Son, is Haereſie. Therefore its peculiar to the Son, and that as Son, then as begotten, and as ſuch, he aſſumes, and becomes the Head of the covenant and ſo he begets and gives being of Adopted Sons to the faithful, ſending his Spirit immutably to ſet their hearts for God, and to hold the bent thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Thus receiving this impreſſion from Chriſt, and ſo from God the Father through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The faithful receiving this impreſſion, as from the Father by Chriſt they return it wholly and perfectly to the Father in and through Chriſt. Namely, The whol man, under their impreſſion of the begetting Spirit of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> it wholly faſtens upon God in Chriſt and ſo leaves it ſelf wholly to be ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed by the influence thereof, and holds out the excellency thereof; that is, not I, but Chriſt; not by my power and might, but by the power of the might of Chriſt. Thus the Sinner is wholly beyond the covenant of works. So that the faithful hath nothing of himſelf, doth nothing from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or for himſelf. As Chriſt the Son doth nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the Father do. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. But God in Chriſt doth al for himſelf in man, man doth it not: receives al himſelf by man, man can take nothing.</p>
                  <p>This I ſaid, was the leaving of the Soul under the influence of the ſpirit, not under a principle of Grace, or ſanctification, for that comes after, is there, is acted and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66082:97"/>preſerved by this. For the ſpirit holds nor us only, but our Graces, quickens and keeps them. But a clinging about God in Chriſt, that he may act al in us and by us. Therefore the Apoſtle joins both theſe Eph. 3.16. Praies that we may <hi>be ſtrengthened by the power of the ſpirit in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the inward man.</hi> The inward man, is the man of Sanctification. Now there is a power of his ſpirit, that gives ſtrengthening vertue to that. This is that for Chriſt to abide in us and we in him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>As the Father abides in Chriſt, ſo Chriſt in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo Chriſt abides in us, and we in him. Chriſt gives al, we receive and return all. Chriſt looks upon us by his ſpirit, we look wholly to Chriſt, or wholly to the influence of that ſpirit in Chriſt; hold out the power and vertue thereof, that it may leave impreſſion of al vertues in us, preſerve, perfect, quicken what it leaves. So that God is in Chriſt, and he as from the Father is in them. God out of his love begets his Son, gives the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Son to him. Chriſt out of his love begets his, gives the being of adoped ones to them. Once more,</p>
                  <p>As Chriſt looks only towards the Father, as his Son begotten, as he receives ſo he returnes. So the faithful, under the impreſſion of the ſpirit of Chriſt, as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and adopted ones, look towards him, leave their hearts with him, as of him, to receive al, as from him, to do al.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt, as begotten of the Father, and one with him, and abiding in him, doth from the Father beget his adopted ones, and makes them one with the Father and himſelf: then doth the Father love the faithful with the like love of union, as his Son iſſues, from a like ground, is in a like manner diſpenſed. Only the odds, is in the meaſure. His love infinite, immediate, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable: This finite, mediate, and proportionable to the condition of a creature. And I cannot ſee, by al
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66082:98"/>the little light I have, how to give a ſavory and ſeaſonable interpretation of the place, but according to this ground. Joh. 10.14, 15. <hi>I know mine;</hi> his ſheep, his Sons, whom he hath taken to himſelf; <hi>and am known of them</hi> his knowing of them makes himſelf to be known, and the riſe from whence this comes, verſe, 15. <hi>As my Father knows me and I am known of my Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God loves the faithful with a like love of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency as he doth the Son: ſtil attend the likeneſs not the largneſs and equality of it with Chriſt, God is firſt wel pleaſed, and in him, with is; and ſuch a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency the Father takes in the Son, as no creature indeed could procure, and therefore no meer creature was able to receive, and without Chriſt none ever could have been made partaker of it. For had <hi>Adam</hi> obeyed the Law, and done that which ſuited the covenant and ſo anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rewarding juſtice of the Lord, yet the revenging juſtice of the Lord had not yet been manifeſted. When then ſin was committed, and an infinite juſtice wrought, and an infinite puniſhment deſerved it was beyond the compaſs of any creature to anſwer that wrong, pay that debt. Therefore the Lord Jeſus takes our Nature, that he may ſuffer, and ſupport our Nature in ſuffering, by the power of his Deity, that it ſink not under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wrath and juſtice of the Father: and ſo this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging juſtice is anſwered to the very ful, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding juſtice pleaſe alſo.</p>
                  <p>And as thus with Chriſt, ſo with the faithful. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.14. They who have the acceptation of God in Chriſt made theirs, to them the Lord extends the love of complacency.</p>
                  <p>But they have the love of God in Chriſt made theirs. and ſet the evidence of this by the proportion.</p>
                  <p>A finite ſin committed againſt an infinite being, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely offends. A finite ſuffering infinitely ſatisfies; becauſe the perſon was infinite that bore it. God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wel pleaſed. Becauſe from the worth of his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66082:98"/>perſon, and the vertue of his Merit, he hath laid down ful Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But he is infinitely pleaſed with the Faithful by way of imputation, becauſe the fruit of that Merit, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from ſuch a perſon, is accounted theirs.</p>
                  <p n="3">God loves the faithful with the love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he wiſheth the like good to them, procures a like good for them, as for Chriſt. He makes them ſharers with him in Chriſt-like priviledges. He only hath the preheminence, and they the ſecond place.</p>
                  <p>They are ſaid to aſcend into Heavenly places, to ſit with Chriſt, to judg the world, yea al enemies to be put under feet. Yea when the Kingdom ſhal be given up by our Savior, no further diſpenſation in any outward means. 1 Cor. 15.28. <hi>God the Father ſhal be all in all,</hi> But in the infinite expreſſions of the riches of al glorious Grace upon the man Chriſt Jeſus, and in and through him, upon them.</p>
                  <p>God the Father hath taken the Lord Chriſt into neereſt union with himſelf. Taken unconceiveable content in him. Advanced him to infinite glory with himſelf. The faithful next to Chriſt, they are in a like manner united to God, as Jeſus, In like manner accepted, as Jeſus, Advanced as Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>And herein lies the Crown of this glory, the Diadem of this Crown, the excellency above the happineſs of Heaven, that none of al this did come from a man, by the power of any Grace, or performance of any work.</p>
                  <p>Hence we have matter of admiration in regard of the goodneſs and kindneſs of the Lord, who is al-ſufficient of himſelf, in himſelf, yet ſhould vouchſafe to look from Heaven to ſuch poor, worthleſs creatures, and to extend ſuch tender compaſſions unto poor wretches. <hi>Tantus, Tantum, Tantillis:</hi> but that we have ſpoken unto.</p>
                  <p>There be many Collections yet remaining: we ſhall touch only ſome, becauſe we would willingly put an

The ſinns of the faithful are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding grievous unto the Lord, above the ſins of al other perſons, they go neereſt unto the heart of the Almighty. Not only againſt light, but again love, yea the greateſt love that could be ſhewed, and therefore cauſe great diſtaſt. If Enemies abuſe and wrong us: If Strangers, to whom we are not known, nor whom we know, deal harſhly and diſcourteouſly with us in our common oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of commerce: or If thoſe of alliance and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who are prophane and ungodly, if they be falſ in their promiſes, or injuſt or injurious in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages towards us: They deal like themſelves, they do but their kind, as we ſay. If falſ hearted perſons deal falſly, If looſe men ſhew themſelves baſe to us, its that they do to al, yea to their own Souls: we expect no other, and therefore if we find no better meaſure, it doth not trouble.</p>
                  <p>If it had been an Enemy, I could have born it, ſaies <hi>David,</hi> but when it comes to that, <hi>It was thou, my familiar Friend, we took ſweet counſel, and went up to the houſe of the Lord together,</hi> It was he that lift up himſelf againſt me, this is more bitter than death.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo with the Lord. If the Ignorant world, who knows him not, who are ſtrangers from him and the convenant of his Grace: If the wicked and prophane, who are profeſſed adverſaries to his Grace and Kingdom, if they diſhonor his name, tranſgreſs his Laws, grieve his ſpirit, and caſt his Ordinances behind their back; It I ſay, the world deal ſo with the Lord, he looks for no other, he hates the world, he never gave his Son for the world, Chriſt never prayed for the world. But that his faithful, whom he hath owned, imbraced in the Bowels of his tendereſt mercies, ſhould deal fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in his covenant, this is killing unkindneſs. <hi>Will ye alſo go away? Joh.</hi> 6.67. When the Crown of thoſe counterfeit wretches, who followed Chriſt for the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66082:99"/>Loaves, when they miſſed of their Dinner and ſweet morſels, they departed preſently, and came no more at him. Our Savior is content to ſee ſo free a riddance of them, and the place quit of their company. But turnes himſelf to his diſciples with that melting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>wil ye alſo go away? q. d.</hi> That they are gone I care not, it matters not, I never knew them, nor was known of them, but wil ye alſo go away? that would be unſufferable.</p>
                  <p>Though Iſrael play the Harlot, yet let not <hi>Judah</hi> offend. And hence it is, The Lord is compelled with ſuch unreaſonable carriages to make his complaint unto the ſenſeleſs creatures, as thoſe who would give in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt ſuch miſcarriages, as profeſſedly croſs to the courſe of things. <hi>Hearken O Heaven, and hear O Earth, I have nouriſhed and brought up Children and they have rebelled againſt me.</hi> Iſa. 1.2.

He hath loved us with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Love; he never ceaseth loving, and we never ceaſe queſtioning, and quarrelling with his kindneſs: we are ever of the jealous, and ſuſpicious hand, that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Lord, it is but for a fit, it wil one day fail, and we ſhal be forſaken utterly:</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt wil ceaſe to be a Son, and to be this wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his Father, with whom he is wel pleaſed; then wil he ceaſe to love thee, to accept of thee, and to be wel pleaſed with thee in him. The one is impoſſible, the other is incredible: and therefore ſtifle thoſe diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red pangs, they are ſo deeply injurious to the Lord, and diſtaſtful to his Majeſty, that he cannot bear them, but wil undoubtedly correct. Such a way-ward, jealous pang ye ſhal perceive in the Church of the Jews in the day of Diſcouragement, when God cals Heaven and Earth to rejoyce in the Conſolation of his People; <hi>Sing O Heavens, and be joyful of Earth, break forth into ſinging, O Mountains; for God hath comforted
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66082:100"/>his People, and will have mercy on his afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 49.13. but they were ſilent in this Quaere, and ſate down in ſullen diſcouragement, verſe 14. <hi>But</hi> Zion <hi>ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the fruit of her Womb?</hi> yea, they may, but <hi>yet will not I forget thee,</hi> verſe 15. and therefore the Lord profeſſeth, he takes it unkindly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou,</hi> O Jacob, <hi>and speakeſt, O Iſrael? amp;c.</hi> This is the dayly talk of al diſmayed, and gloomy, diſcouraged Spirits; it's al they ſpeak, and have in their Meetings; <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaies, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpeaks, this is common. <hi>My way in hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is paſſed over of my God.</hi> Thus ye ſay, but what ſaies God? <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou? &amp;c.</hi> q. d. I cannot abide thoſe words. God cannot brook ſuch groundleſs ſuſpicions of his Favor, which is more ſure than the Foundations of the Earth. As it is whith men, who are real and cordial in their kindneſs, and ſincere hearted in the expreſſion of their Love; ſo that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave the leaſt appearance of any inſtability, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs in their Promiſes, and Performances, as either their engagements, or others deſires or neceſſities ſhould require: if yet their Friends, and intimate Familiars, ſhould out of their jealouſie, either caſt out ſuch words in their preſence, or give it in their expreſſions to others to underſtand, That however they have ever been free in the manifeſtation of their Favor, and they have ever found them faithful, that they cannot challenge them in the leaſt; yet they fear in the iſſue, when it comes to a dead lift, they wil leave in the lurch: Should ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions be dayly preſented before a man, and ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind expreſſions be laid in his diſh; he could not but with indignation caſt off ſuch a one. Why? have I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed of my Word? ever been wanting in my labor, to anſwer al your deſires? beſtead you in al your needs? and have I this for my love and labor, that ye look at me

We are advanced as Chriſt, he wiſheth al good, and works al good for us, as for him; ſets us far above al Principalities and Powers, and what is named in this World, or the World to come. Though we know it not, underſtand it not, if it be named, or can be conceived, it ſhal never prevail againſt our Comforts. We are brought neer to him, and made one with him, as Chriſt; nothing ſhal be able to ſeparate us from his Favor. Chriſt is in God, we in Chriſt; and therefore the power of darkneſs muſt pluck us out of his hand, nay, from his boſom. As the Father cannot be without the Son, nor Chriſt perfect without us; Satan and Sin, muſt take ſomthing of Chriſt his perfection, if he take away our Comforts. Hither <hi>Paul</hi> repairs, and here he Lands his Heart and Hopes in ſafety, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor things preſent, nor things to come</hi> (ſome troubles and dangers are over, but it may be, there may be more, and more ſharp to come, who knows what may be? why come what can come) <hi>nor height, nor depth</hi> (if any thing in Heaven, nor any thing in Hel) <hi>nor any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhal be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God in Chriſt.</hi> The Holy Apoſtles intent it, to ſettle this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion upon the Conſciences of the Romans, that the happineſs of their Condition, and the certainty thereof, was beyond the reach of al the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66082:103"/>God in Chriſt towards his. It was before al theſe things, therefore they come too late, they cannot hinder it: It was without any reſpect to them, therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not weaken it: It was only, and wholly in God, and from God, and therefore cannot alter it: The Devils, and ſin, may as wel ſeparate Chriſt from the Father, as they pul the Love of the Father from his own heart, and ſo from Chriſt, as to ſeparate us from it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.33. <hi>My loving kindneſs, I will never take from him:</hi> He may take away our Credits, Comforts, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Ordinances, yea, the work of our Grace, our Peace; but never take away his loving kindneſs, nor ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail: Heart, Hopes, Comforts may fail; but never this Love. Only remember, He may take away the ſence of it, the ſweet, and relliſh of it for a turn and time. So with Chriſt, when he loved him: ſo with us, while he tenders us. So with Chriſt, while our ſins lay upon him by imputation: ſo with us, while our ſins lie upon us without Humiliation. So with Chriſt, while his Juſtice is ſatisfied: ſo with us, until his Righteouſneſs comes to be imputed.</p>

                  <p>Study therefore to anſwer Gods Love in our manner, and according to our meaſure. He thought nothing too good for us, let us account nothing good enough for him. Let not the Lord have the leaneſt of our Love, the Female Affection, the leavings of any thing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: We had the chief of his Love, let us lay out the choyceſt of our Affections wholly, and only upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before al Creatures we prize. They are nothing, yea, leſs than nothing, In compariſon of the Lord, let them be ſo in our Affections: they are nothing, let them have nothing of our Love; but reſerve that only for the Almighty, who is only worthy of it. The Wife ſhe receives ſtrangers into her Houſe, to entertain, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66082:103"/>lodg them; Neighbors to her Conference, to counſel them; Familiars to her Table, to welcome them: but her Husband only hath her heart and love. So let thy Prudence order theſe things, thy hand uſe them, thy skil and diligence husband them: but keep thy Love for God alone; yea, give away thy Heart from thy ſelf, to God, to whom thou oweſt it, more than to thy ſelf. Let not thy Life be dear unto thee, that thou mayeſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thy courſe; loſe that, to gain him; caſt away that, to content him. As Lovers, they count it happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they may have any thing to pleaſure: glad we have it for a Friend. As the Martyr, he was ſorry he had but one Life to loſe for God. Yea, love him, as Chriſt loves him; and that's in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He came not to do his own Will,</hi> John, 6.38. <hi>but the Will of his Father.</hi> Do thou likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>As our Savior in another like caſe, profeſſed the Zeal of Gods Houſe had eaten him up, eaten up al his Zeal for his own Honor, or Ends. So let the Wil of God, and Strength, and Authority of it, carry our Wils, as a mighty Stream doth the weaker Current: whatever is croſs to us, let nothing be croſs to him. <hi>Not my will, &amp;c. The will of the Lord be done.</hi> As our Savior, <hi>The Son doth nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the Father do.</hi> John, 5.19.30. So do thou.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Savior ſought not his own Honor, but the Glory of him that ſent him.

            <p>There is one point yet remaining, wherein the ſcope and end of our Saviors prayer is expreſſed, and indeed directly intended in the words.</p>
            <p>There is a double end here mentioned by our Savior, why he ſo earneſtly and ſo importunately purſues the requeſt at the hands of his Father in ſo many ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. That they might be one as the Father and he was one: The means how this comes to be attained, and order how diſpenſed: I <hi>in them, and thou in me.</hi> The perfection which was aimed at, <hi>That they might be perfect in one.</hi> Here laſtly we have a double end;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 1. Touching the honor of our Savior, that it might be manifeſted and magnified even in the hearts, and by the mouths of the wicked, even the worſt of men, that wil they, nil they, they ſhould be forced to ſee it, and forced alſo to confeſs it, that the Lord Jeſus was the Meſſias of the world, appointed by the Father before al
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66082:104"/>worlds, foretold by Prophets, exhibited and ſent in the fulneſs of time by God the Father; and he that hath accompliſhed that great work of our redemption, and that unto the ful. That the ignorant, who never knew him, the ſtubborn and rebellious amongſt whom he lived, and preached, yet would not receive him, yea the flinty hearted Jews, that ſcorned and deſpiſed the meanneſs of his perſon and the power of his diſpenſation; Al theſe at laſt ſhould be conſtrained to acknowledg that he is the true and only Meſſias, ſet a part and ſent to that work. <hi>This is the Son of God,</hi> ſaies the Heathen, of whom we have heard, but never laboured to know him. This is the Son of God, ſaies the prophane, whom we in his word have oppoſed, and hated in his ſervants. This is the Son of God, ſent to ſave us, and we have blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed his name, and flame, and crucified his perſon, deſpiſed his government ſaies the Jew. See the lively expreſſion of this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.13. This, I ſay, wil cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to paſs, for our Savior hath prayed for it, yea purſued it with re-doubled deſires, propounded in the 21. Verſe, repeated in verſe, 23. And he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies heard in what he begged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence we have two things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Its lawful to begg the ſame thing ſeveral times, in the ſame prayer. We have here a pattern before us, beyond al compare, a practiſe beyond al exception, nay in truth, beyond al queſtion or doubt.</p>
            <p>He cannot do but wel, who could not erre in what he did, where he hath gone before us in his example, in things imitable, we may without either feare or hazard ſafely go after him. As it was ſaid of his ſpeaking, and its as true of his praying, he prayed as never man did. And there do not many ſentences paſs between, but ye have the very ſame petition expreſſed.</p>
            <p>What our Savior did, its lawful for us upon the like
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66082:105"/>occaſion and like grounds for us to do, to put up the ſame petition ſeveral times, the ſame prayer. If we find we have greater need of that we ask, than any other, or if there be ſpecial worth in it, or that our hearts grow warmer in the work, and increaſe into the ſtrength of our affection towards the thing we ask: For then there is no vain babling, or empty repetition but the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, though the ſame, have new ſtrength of freſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and affections put upon them, Therefore <hi>David</hi> again unto the place ſtriks the ſame ſtring of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which made beſt melody in that muſick and ſong of his. <hi>Oh that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs and declare the wonders he doth for the Children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to pray moſt earneſtly, that the power of our Savior might be expreſſed, that his right appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the work of Redemption might be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the world.</p>
            <p>Its that which our Savior doubles his deſires for the attainement of, as that wherein the great weight of the work lay, and which he counted worthy ſuch importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſeeking for, at the hands of his Father. And this carriage ſhould be a Copy and Sampler to conform our prayers unto. This is that which God the Father is ſo Zealous of; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. When he brings his firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the world, he ſaies, <hi>Worſhip him all ye An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God.</hi> And to this purpoſe was the eight Pſalm penned, and is to be underſtood touching our Savior, as having the preheminence, above al creatures in Heaven and Earth, as Mediator. So the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> ſeems to expound it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.20. Learned <hi>Junius</hi> judgeth, and therefore here the Pſalmiſt dwels and delights to deſcant on this ſtrain. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1. O Lord our God, how excellent is thy Name in al the world. That's moſt worthy our deſires, upon which our Savior ſpent his. This only from the repetition.</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:66082:105"/>
            <p>The point it ſelf we ſpake unto on verſe, 21. So much of the firſt end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second End is this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Savior prayes that they might be perfect in one, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> that ſo the world alſo might know, that the Father hath loved them, as he loved him. This is for the honor and excellency of beleevers in the acknowledgment of the world. That howſoever, while they are wildering here in this vale of teares, they become the ſcorn of the wicked, the ſcrapings of men, as the Apoſtle hath it, and the Off-ſcouring of the world in the miſguided ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the wicked of the world, who know not how to judg aright of things and perſons, and therefore account them Out-caſts of Heaven and Earth; yet our Savior prayes, that they may proceed on to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Oneneſs with the Father and himſelf, unto which one day they ſhal attain in Heaven. That the world may be conſtrained to ſee and ſay, that indeed they are Gods precious ones, to whom his Soul is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly indeared in ſurpaſſing love, even like unto that, wherewith he hath loved the Lord Jeſus his only Son. This our Savior Chriſt prayes for, as a means to this end, and therefore it wil undoubtedly attain it.</p>
            <p>There be two points in the worlds.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The world ſhal know, that the Father hath loved the faithful, as he loved Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>This ſhall then be known, when they come to be perfectly one with the Father and Son in Heaven.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But we ſhal handle them both together, becauſe they border ſo neer, each upon other, and the explication of either wil add to the diſcovery, and ſo to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both.</p>

               <p>That is the truth of the point, before we can come to the Reaſon, there muſt be two Queſtions anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which wil give in the light of explication to the ſeveral branches of the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">Queſt. 1. <hi>How wicked men, the world, can be truly ſaid, to know the love of God to beleevers, which is ſo ſpecial a ſecret, that it is not</hi> (many times) <hi>made known to Gods own, for many years together: nay the Apoſtle profeſſeth, it exceedeth knowledg.</hi> Eph. 3.19. <hi>At leaſt, this new name writ upon the White-ſtone no man knows but he that hath it. And therefore this love ſeems to be beyond the reach of the world, too far off, for their blind Eyes to ſee:</hi> yea the Apoſtle profeſſeth, <hi>they have not received the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit of God, that they might know the things, that are graciouſly given them of God: and is one, if not the cheifeſt of al thoſe good things given, the ſurpaſſing indearedneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affection to his. How then can the world, who have no other, but the Spirit of the world be able to know this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer three things, wherein the meaning of the places wil be opened, and the weight of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection removed and taken away.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To diſcern and judg of the ſpiritualneſs of the work of any ſaving Grace, is wholly beyond the ability and reach of any natural man: much more unable is he to know Gods love therein, or to view the beauty and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66082:107"/>ſurpaſſing ſweetneſs thereof. Theſe waies of Wiſedom are too high for a Fool. He muſt have Gods Eye-ſalve, that muſt be able to ſee the things of Gods Grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, much more in another. All ſanctifying works are peculiar to the Saints.</p>
               <p>There is ſanctifying work in the underſtanding, to act it, and inable it to cloſe with its object, as well, as any ſanctifying work upon any of the other faculties: and this is proper to the Saints.</p>
               <p>And the Scripture is plain and peremptory, <hi>the world knows not the Father nor Chriſt:</hi> Nor yet any that are begotten of Chriſt: and ſo neither the love of the Father conveyed by Chriſt unto any. 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>Therefore the world knows us not, becauſe it knows not him.</hi> And upon this ground it is, they are called, <hi>Gods hidden ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Though the world and wicked men cannot diſcern, nor rightly underſtand what this love is, nor the ſpiritual Nature of it, which is done by a ſpiritual light; yet they may know, and then they ſhal-know, that God the Father hath and doth affect them with a moſt peculiar love, both glorious for the manner, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable for the meaſure of it, even next unto the Lord Jeſus: and this ſhal be diſcovered by the fruits of this love, and the amazing expreſſions of the riches of his mercy, which then ſhal appeare upon the faithful, in their deliverance from ſo great evils which is wrought for them, the crowning of them, with that <hi>Exceſſive, Exceeding weight of glory,</hi> with which they ſhal ſtand poſſeſſed, and that unto the aſtoniſhment of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the torment of their Souls with envy and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereat.</p>
               <p>No man knows the affection of a Father, or Husband, but thoſe that are in that eſtate and condition: becauſe its a ſecret of Nature, which is only to be ſeen in the impreſſion of the work: yet that a Father loves his Son, above al other his deareſt friends, and neereſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66082:107"/>That the Husband tenders his Spouſe with an indeared affection above al mortal creatures: This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the expreſſions of his reſpect, that all he hath, is at her command, al he can do, is wholly improved for her content and comfort, ſhe lies in his Boſom, and his heart truſts, in her, which forceth al to confeſs, that the ſtream of his affection, like a mighty current, runs with ful Tide and ſtrength; Though what that affection is, he doth not know: yet this he knows, <hi>The choiceſt affection is there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it was with <hi>Haman,</hi> when the Queſtion was by the King made, <hi>What ſhal be done to the Man, whom the King will Honor?</hi> He expreſſed his opinion, and was forced to put it alſo in practiſe. He then knew who was moſt deep and dear in the Kings Royal affection. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.20. When God makes up his Jewels, then men ſhal diſcern betwixt him that ſerveth the Lord, and him that ſerveth him not, how ever happily before they were al ſhuffled up together, and then there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencing betwixt the moſt precious Jewel, and the moſt reffuſe Pebble.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It is a grounded Acknowledgment from a ſenſible Experience of the contrary. Condition, which they have obſerved in their own Souls, and therefore now it's paſt gainſaying, when their own ſenſe gives in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Evidence without alteration; of which, more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>If Conviction be ſetled, ſo as it cannot be removed; their Experience undeniable, which brings in Evidence that cannot be gain-ſayed; then it's true, <hi>The World may be ſaid to know that there is ſuch a Love of God to the Saints.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Life Spiritual of the Saints, is hid and concealed while they wilder up and down in this Vale of Tears, clouded partly with ſorrows and miſeries which attend them, as a conſtant Companion in a Chriſtian Courſe; partly collied and bemited with corruptions of their hearts and lives: ſo that neither the beauty of Gods Grace, nor the tender expreſſions of Gods Love, doth in any peculiar manner appear in them; and go no further than the Judgment of Senſe, they are the moſt forlorn, deſpicable Perſons upon the face of the Earth. And truly, <hi>were their hopes only in this life, they were of all men moſt miſerable;</hi> and further than this Life, men do not look, nor can in truth ſee, wanting Faiths Proſpective, <hi>which is the Evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> that they ſo judg, nay, conclude it, as beyond controverſie.</p>
               <p>And this ſomtime ſtumbled holy <hi>Aſaph, Pſal.</hi> 73. See alſo, 1 John, 3.1, 2. <hi>Our Life is hid with Chriſt in God: when Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in Glory.</hi>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:66082:108"/>
               <p n="2">Becauſe their Underſtandings are wholly perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their hearts alſo ſo corrupt, that they are not able to judg of the Love of the Lord, or the evidencing expreſſions thereof. The god of this World hath ſo blinded their eyes, that the beauty of Gods Grace, and ſo the beams and heat of Gods Love cannot come home to their Conſciences, to convince them thereof: And ſuch is the corrupt diſtempered frame of their hearts, that they ſavor only the things of the Fleſh; and not to have things ſuit their ſenſual Appetite, or to contrive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments to their own carnal Affections, they count it the greateſt curſe and expreſſion of Gods diſtaſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure that may be. The carnal heart ſavors the things of the Fleſh, nothing ſeems ſweet, unleſs it ſuits his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. So that,</p>
               <p>If the Life of a Beleever, and ſo the Evidences of Gods Love be hid, and cannot be diſcerned:</p>
               <p>The hearts and minds of the World, be ſo perverted and ſurfeted with the ſweetneſs of their own luſts, that they cannot judg of the fruits of Gods Love, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before them:</p>
               <p>Then it is no marvel that they do not know it, nor acknowledg it as diſpenſed to the Saints.</p>
               <p>The Point now explicated, <hi>the Reaſons which give in the Proof thereof, will appear more eaſie, and more undeniably plain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. At the Day of Judgment, the World of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they come to have convicting Evidence, which can neither be gain-ſayed, nor wil ever be removed, what is a never failing proof of Gods Love, by the ſenſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Experience they have of Gods direful hatred and diſpleaſure upon their own Souls. Their hearts now find it, and feel it; their Conſciences confeſs it; their Judgments acknowledg it, that the Plague of al Plagues, the Curſe of al Curſes, that wherein the venom of Gods
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66082:109"/>Vengeance and infinite Indignation and hatred of the Lord from his Bleſſing and comforting preſence, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed from the Preſence of the Lord, and the Glory of his Power; the glorious and powerful expreſſion of his ſaving Mercy. However formerly the ſoul while it was ſurfeting in its ſinful diſtempers, found no greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, nor conceived any greater favor, than to have it ful of its own luſts, and not to be croſſed with the Counſel of the Lord; and concluded no other Heaven, nor hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs like the enjoying of their hearts delight, without check of God or Conſcience. Yet now he ſees the ſweet and ſurfets of thoſe ſins, become the greateſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto him, the very quinteſſence of the Curſe, and the ſubſtance of the Sentence of Condemnation <hi>(De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye curſed)</hi> was the Commiſſion thereof; I thought nothing ſo delightful, that I might without gainſaying depart from God by ſinning: therein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Gods Indignation doth wholly appear, to caſt me out of his preſence, and to ſtake me down in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, never to ſee his face, enjoy his preſence, come within the ſmile of his Favor any more.</p>
               <p>Therefore thoſe who are brought ſo neer to God, ſo accepted of him, Chriſt at the right hand of the Father, they at the right hand of Chriſt, being ever with him; what that Love is, we cannot tel, that is beyond our reach, yet it is a fruit of the greateſt Love, we cannot but ſee and confeſs, our departure being the fearful fruit of Gods fierce diſpleaſure. Thus <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> brings them in at the day of Judgment taking the ſhame to themſelves, which formerly they caſt upon the Saints. <hi>We Fools thought this mans life madneſs; but now he is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and we caſt out of Gods fight and preſence for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are fully convinced, and experimentally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that al this comes from Chriſt, and not from them; and from Chriſt as the Head of the Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: for from <hi>Adam</hi> it could not come, in whom they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66082:109"/>had a like ſhare, as al the Sons of Men, hewed out of the ſame Rock, and digged out of the ſame Pit, had the ſame Nature, as they; had as good Abilities, and as great means as they: and yet notwithſtanding, they found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond their power, nay, their own Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions either to attain this, nay, it could not enter once into their thoughts, that they who knew not Chriſt, ſhould receive him, they who oppoſed him, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one Spiritually, and one Spirit with him, even as neer as the Members to the Head: for ſo they now hear the Saints acknowledg it, it was the Son that died for them, that was ſent from the living Father, that they might live through him. They now ſee the Son of God, the Lord Jeſus ſtands betwixt them, and al their harms, that no Devils can accuſe them, that no malice can charge them; but Chriſt ſaies, I have undertaken, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſatisfied, and they now come to be accepted, as he, advanced as he, ſet up on the Throne to judg as he, and to regin as he, through al Eternity.</p>
               <p>They who receive al this good from the Father through Chriſt, as the Head of the Covenant, for them, and in their behalf; and enjoy al next unto Chriſt: they are loved as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. O! we wretches ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, when God loved them; contemned them, when God honored them: we did not know them, and therefore wo unto us; we deſpiſed them, we looked at them, as the baſeſt of al men, when they were more than men, yea, more excellent than the Angels, the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Members of Chriſt, the Beloved of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt, yea, beloved as Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Hence we have matter of Patience for the Saints of God: they are the contempt of the wicked, the ſcorn of the World, the Object of the ignominy and reproach of ungodly men: But their Life is hid with Chriſt in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66082:110"/>God, beyond their ken, their reach and reaſon; and no wonder they know nor them nor Chriſt, <hi>The God of this World hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts:</hi> no marvel, that what they cannot ſee, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judg aright of, they know not the things of the God of Heaven, nor the work of his Grace, nor the worth of his Servants.</p>
                  <p>The Saints are Princes, but they are not in their Country, they are in ſtrange places, and amongſt ſtrange People, who do not know them, and therefore cannot honor them: and therefore they are content to bear it for the while, to ſtay til they come into their own Countrey, and to the day of Coronation. Saies <hi>Paul,</hi> I paſs not for mans day. <hi>This is mans day,</hi> but at that day, the day of Jeſus, &amp;c.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66082:110"/>it's out of Love, it's to take down our Bodies, not to deſtroy them; to take out of the World, becauſe he loves us, to take us neerer to himſelf. How ſhould this ſettle us, and eſtabliſh us in al Change? There is an end of al things, and an end of al Perfections; but whom God loves, he loves to the end.

And that, Either eſpecially for his Apoſtles, becauſe the greatneſs of the Work now under their hand, their preſſures and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that would neceſſarily attend them therein, the large meaſure of Grace and Abilities that might ſuit them to ſo weighty and Spiritual employment, together with the need of more than an ordinary preſence and aſſiſtance of the Lord, without which, they would not only be unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a buſineſs of that worth, but wholly diſcouraged in it. Therefore the Lord Jeſus laies in for a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Spiritual ſupply and relief for them in the firſt place, and here he is marvelous importunate, to verſe 20.</p>
            <p>Or elſe for al the Faithful, that ever did, or for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould beleeve in him unto the end of the World, whoſe caſe he commends from Verſe 20. and the things

            <p>Thus the Lord laies in Proviſion, and that in a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner:
<list>
                  <item>1. That which might fit them for their way and Voyage, while they are travelling towards their home.</item>

Our Savior is not ſatisfied until he ſee them in the Haven, ſafely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in Heaven with himſelf, beyond al the rage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and malice of Men, dangers of Sin, or the ſorrows of the Grave, and Death.</p>
            <p>In this 24. Verſe, and Prayer of our Savior, we may attend Four Things:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A Deſcription of the Parties for whom Chriſt praies,</hi> from that Spiritual reſpect and relation they had to him, <hi>Thoſe that thou haſt given me,</hi> together with the cauſe of it; <hi>his Father gave them.</hi>
                  </item>

                  <item>3. The <hi>End</hi> why he begs this: <hi>That they might be with him, that they might ſee the Glory of Chriſt which hath been given him of the Father.</hi> Not that they might have any Glory in themſelves, or ſee, or ſatisfie themſelves with their own glory: but that they might gaze upon the Glory of the Lord Jeſus through al Worlds, and that's al they have to do in Heaven.</item>
                  <item>4. We have the firſt Fountain whence this Glory proceeds, to wit, hence; Becauſe the Father hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, before the Foundation of the World was laid.</item>

            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>It's the care of our Savior to ſeek and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the welfare of his Servants, even till they come to the fulneſs of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</head>
               <p>See here in the words of the Text, the inlarged ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of the heart of the Lord Jeſus, he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf to look to his diſciples and ſo beleevers, while they were but in the ſhel, Babes in Chriſtianity; nor ſatisfies himſelf, that he hath purchaſed and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame glorious Grace upon them, which he hath received from his Father. Nor yet doth he count it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that he hath preſſed the Father with ſuch unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant importunity to intreate, that they might be kept in that Oneneſs of relation to the Father and the Son, as they are one with another, and one in another, which notwithſtanding in reaſon might have been conceived to have been a large proviſion, a goodly portion and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, even for the choiceſt of Gods ſervants, to be ſo left by God the Father and the Lord Jeſus with ſo faire an eſtate; that in reaſon they might have been able to maintain themſelves wel, and not only made a ſhift to live Chriſtianly, but honorably, and with much content, ſince the Lord had left them wherewithal, and aforehand in the world, ſo fully ſtocked and ſtored:</p>
               <p>But alas, this is little in the Eye of the Lord Chriſt, do we but conſider the endleſs compaſſions, which he extends towards ſuch: He laies in with God the Father, for their welfare in another world, ſtores up for eternity in their behalf. <hi>Father I will they be, where I am.</hi> He wil not forſake them, before he ſee them wel arrived and in ſafety: therefore doth not aſcend to Heaven, and leave them to the wide world, to ſink, or ſwim, and ſhift for themſelves. No, he hath laid in proviſion of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66082:113"/>prayer anſwerable to al their occaſions, their changes, and neceſſities, in life, in death, after Death. In life, Lead them: keep them in their Graves, raiſe them out of their Graves, bring them to glory, and preſerve them in glory for ever: He wil not have his glory, but they muſt ſee it, nay his glory wil not ſatisfie, unleſs he may ſee them.</p>
               <p>If our Savior pray for this their being with him; then prayes he for and provids and alſo ſucceeds al means to attain this.</p>
               <p>As wiſe Merchants victual their ſhipps for the longeſt time: our Savior victuals, even for a Voyage of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for life, for death, for Grace, for Glory; for a Momentany paſſage of time in this world, and for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in another: he laies out for their preſent needs; but Oh how great is that goodneſs thou haſt laid up for them that feare thee? like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> provide for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years Famin, laies in proviſion of prayer for their everlaſting ſupply. The Saints may find even refreſhing baits by this prayer of our Savior, in their moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing diſtreſſes, feaſt their hearts with it. Hence it is, the Lord Chriſt is ſaid, Hebr. 7.25. <hi>To be able to ſave them to the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>moſt that come to God by him,</hi> that is, by the vertue of his eternal interceſſion, of which this prayer is one part. This was ſignified by thoſe two types, The Pillar of fire, and the Pillar of cloud, which went before the Iſraelites in their travailes. Its ſaid, <hi>The Lord went before them in a Pillar.</hi> Exord. 13.21, 22. <hi>He took not away the Pillar of Cloud by day, and the Pillar of Fire by night,</hi> from before his people, until he brought them into the promiſed Land. Thus the Lord Jeſus leads his people into the way everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and withdraws not the power of his prayer, and preſence, and proviſion of al mercies, until he bring them to himſelf.</p>
               <p>So again <hi>Moſes</hi> left the people in the deſert and died before he came into the good Land: but <hi>Joſhua</hi> brought
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66082:113"/>them to the place of reſt, of which it was ſaid, they ſhal remove no more. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law leaves a man in ſin and miſery, even to periſh, while he is in his paſſage: but our <hi>Joſhua</hi> brings his to reſt that yet remains: for there is yet a reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining for Gods people. When he went away, and withdrew his Bodily preſence, yet his Bowels yerned towards his, I wil not leave you as Orphans. Joh. 14.18. <hi>He ſends the comforter, his bleſſed ſpirit to lead them into al truth,</hi> To guid them in the way, while they are wildering here towards the end of their Hopes: And his care is even in Heaven, to prepare manſions of reſt for their welcome and refreſhing, after their weary-some travailes. Joh. 14.2. <hi>In my Fathers Houſe are many manſions, I go to prepare a place for you and I wil come again and receive you.</hi> And before he comes, he ſends poſt to meet his poor ſervants, and to inquire of their welfare. Joh. 16.22. <hi>I will ſee you again, and your heart ſhal rejoyce.</hi> This was the meaning of the viſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14, 16. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw a Ladder, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſcending and deſcending, and the Lord ſtanding at the top: and he ſaid, <hi>I wil bleſs thee, and be with thee where ever thou goeſt and</hi> I <hi>wil not leave thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til</hi> I <hi>have performed that which</hi> I <hi>have ſpoken to thee of.</hi>

Its the charge which he hath undertaken, and unto which he ſtands bound, by free agreement with God the Father, that he wil ſee to the everlaſting welfare of his ſervants: and therefore in faithfulneſs he cannot, but with al care perform it. That by no means, in no caſe, they do miſcarry. It was the main ſcope of his ſending by the Father, and of his coming into the world. Joh. 6.38, 39. I <hi>came not to do mine own wil but the wil of my Father that ſent me, that of thoſe which he hath
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66082:114"/>given me,</hi> I <hi>ſhould looſe none, but raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> Nay for this purpoſe he received <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion</hi> From God the Father. Joh. 17.2. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over al fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many, as thou haſt given him.</hi> He hath given Jeſus Chriſt power over al enemies of the ſalvation of his people, that they ſhould never be able to hinder them: over al means which might procure their good, that they ſhould never be wanting, to help and further them in the good waies of Gods Grace: power over al wants, weakneſſeſs, infirmities, that they ſhould never be able to diſcourage their hearts in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe. He wil not fail of his end, they cannot fail of their comforts. 1 Cor. 15.25, 26. <hi>He muſt reign until he hath put al his enemies under his feet: the laſt enemy, that is to be deſtroyed is death.</hi> The Lord wil ſee the laſt enemy deſtroyed, and ſee them beyond death and danger. So that our Savior wil come laſt out of the field, as Conqueror, and wil not leave his people, their Souls under diſtreſſes, or their bodies in their Graves: and make them Conquerors and triumph over al their Adverſaries. O Death, where is thy ſting, O Grave, where is thy Victory: thanks be given to God, who hath given us the Victory through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

The love of our Savior conſtraines him to lay out himſelf and the improvement of his power and prayers, and al he hath for their good in al conditions, until they come to be with him. Joh. 13.1. <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them to the end.</hi> In love there is no lack: if he love them to the end, he wil care for them, and their comforts unto the end. He loves and tenders in al their neceſſities and occaſions, therefore wil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly relieve and ſuccour them in al; Therefore the Apoſtle concludes ſo confidently: nor life, nor death, nor Principalities, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If death cannot put an end to his love, It skils not though it put an end to our lives; his love wil quicken and raiſe. If he love us in priſon, he wil deviſe means to free us. Love us in temptation, he wil provide Grace and Comfort to ſtrengthen &amp; ſuſtain us in al our trials. It was an argument which they pleaded, and by which they ſupported their hearts for help in the death of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi> Joh. 11.3. <hi>He whom thou loveſt is Sick, and then he recovered him:</hi> He whom thou loveſt is overwhelmed with temptations and diſtempers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhal be comforted and delivered.</p>

                  <p>This ye ſhal find moſt plain in the very expreſs words of our Savior, when he diſcovers this Work, <hi>John,</hi> 17.6. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name to the Men, which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me out of the World.</hi> He gets them out of the hand of the World, from the <hi>luſt of the eyes,</hi> and <hi>luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> 1 John, 2.16. For that is al, which is in the World; and from al theſe, whether
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66082:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>the vanity of the Creature, with which our Eye and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are taken from without; or the ſenſual filth, and dunghil ſteams of noyſom diſtempers, which ariſe of our own Concupiſcence; or whether it be Pride, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening Self-confidence, which ariſeth, and iſſues out of al. this is al that is in the World, and from al theſe, the Father gains the Souls of thoſe men, he gives unto his Son.</p>
                  <p>For they had given away themſelves unto theſe Luſts of the World, and that muſt be repealed, before this could be tendred afreſh.</p>
                  <p>And here again by the way, ye may obſerve, That this <hi>Giving,</hi> cannot be the Act of <hi>Electing:</hi> for that is an eminent Act, and remains in Gods Breaſt and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and goes not out: This is called a <hi>Tranſient Act,</hi> is an Act which paſſeth upon the Creature.</p>
                  <p>That is without reſpect and conſideration of Mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much leſs the being of Sin, as ye have fully heard.</p>
                  <p>But this ſuppoſeth a man in the <hi>World,</hi> that is, under the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Vanity</hi> thereof, if he muſt be given <hi>out of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God the Father doth actually deliver up the Soul into the hand of Jeſus, commends it to his keeping, to rule him in the Kingdom of Grace, while here he remains in this World, and to bring him to Glory hereafter. He gives the Soul, and our Savior takes it, and undertakes for it, as his Charge, according to the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Agreement made between the Father and him.</p>
                  <p>The Expreſſion of <hi>Calvin,</hi> is pat and pleaſant. God the Father cauſeth the Soul to paſs into the Care and Cuſtody of the Lord Jeſus, leaves him in the power and poſſeſſion of his Son Jeſus, as the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Head of the Covenant of Grace, that he may ſee him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
                  <p>As the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> neglected the Covenant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed himſelf, and his Poſterity: There was a Parly and Conſultation held between the Father and the Lord
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66082:119"/>Jeſus, touching the Salvation of his Elect, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement fully tranſacted and paſſed. But now it comes to be put into Execution, and he gives them into the hand of Chriſt: The Soul comes into Chriſts preſence, and Chriſt comes to ſpeech with it.</p>
                  <p>Behold the party I wil have redeemed, and the Lord takes him as his Charge, and provides for him, both to bring him to himſelf, and ſo to Life and Salvation, which he hath purchaſed, and poſſeſſeth, and can communicate. The Soul as yet conſents not, nor hath the powerful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Gods Grace come home to the heart: God gives the Soul, the Soul doth not yet give up it ſelf, but God giving to Chriſt, as his charge put, and paſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his care; He undertakes to get the good wil of the Soul, and to bring it to himſelf, and through himſelf to Life and Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the Father hath thus delivered the Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the care of Chriſt; he then gives Chriſt to the Soul, reveals the Lord Jeſus as the Surety and Savior, that hath covenanted with the Father, and hath purchaſed al from the Father for him; ſo that there is nothing that can ſtand betwixt Mercy and him.</p>
                  <p>This Chriſt and Mercy, ſo provided, and intended for his good, is now rendered and given to him. Behold thy Savior, who is the Head of the Covenant of Grace, who hath purchaſed, and procured, by the Fathers Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, al good for thee, and can, and wil, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate al good to thee: This leaves a mighty impreſſion of the ſweet of the good upon the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Thus God tendring Chriſt, and through him mercy, as he that hath covenanted with the Father, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the ſoul, commended to his care by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This tender of a Chriſt, and of Mercy in him, makes the Soul take it: this offering of Chriſt, as one, to whom he was before given to ſave, works the heart to receive Chriſt, and that is beleeving, which is thus wrought (as ye ſee) by the giving of the Soul to Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:66082:119"/>
                  <p>Becauſe Chriſt gave himſelf, and Mercy to the Soul, therefore the Soul comes to him. But becauſe the Soul was given to Chriſt, and his care, he gave himſelf, and mercy to it. Therefore the Soul was given to Chriſt; therefore it comes, and beleeves.</p>
                  <p>If God the Father had not given the Soul to Chriſt, he ad never taken care of him, never given himſelf to them; they never received him, nor good from him.</p>
                  <p>Hence Beleeving is ſaid to be Receiving; and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving we know, as a Co-relative, is the cauſe of giving.</p>

               <div n="2" type="reason">
                  <head>REASON 2.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are the Fathers own; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath moſt right and reaſon to diſpoſe of them, and to give them away, as he ſees ſit, when it wil be moſt ſeaſonable to procure the good and comfort therof. This is the ground our Savior goes upon, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt &amp;c.</hi> Each man hath moſt to do with that, which is his proper right. Now the Father had ſet his heart upon them, before the World, and appointed them to be Veſſels of Mercy, in his everlaſting purpoſe: and therefore it's but equal, that he ſhould order al things for the accompliſhment of the Counſel of his own Will, and the performance of his Soveraign good Pleaſure without controul, <hi>John,</hi> 6. <hi>I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me: and this is the will of him that ſent me, That I ſhould loſe none that he hath given me.</hi> It's ſit that God ſhould do his own Will, whoſe Will is the abſolute Firſt-Cauſe of all things that are done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Gods own Right, ſo their own proper, and peculiar good, is hereby eſpecially, if not only, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For had not God the Father, given them to his Son, he would not, nay, I may truly ſay, he never could have given Grace, and Mercy, or Good to them, in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous way, preſerving the Right and Honor of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66082:120"/>and ſo the Glory of himſelf. For had not Chriſt taken the care and charge of us, the Juſtice of God would never have ſuffered him to have ſhewed us Mercy: we ſhould never have been fitted, nor enabled to receive Mercy. For we having wronged his Juſtice, and provoked his Anger, by reaſon of our Transgreſſions, his Juſtice would have ſtood offended, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure incenſed againſt us, by reaſon thereof. Nay, he did give a Commiſſion to our ſins, under the hand of Divine Juſtice, to take vengeance of the Soul; and this ſtopped the influence of Gods Mercy, or the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of God from coming to our Souls; and being now under the guilt and power of our ſins, though mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had been tendred, we were utterly diſenabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, having no power thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But when Jeſus Chriſt takes the charge of us, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes in our behalf, he takes off al the impediments on Gods part, anſwers his Juſtice, and appeaſeth his Wrath, that ſo they wil not ſtand betwixt us and our Comfort; but an open paſſage is made for the good pleaſure of the Lord, to be fully manifeſted, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation and communication of Mercy tendred and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath called us according to the purpoſe of his Grace, which was given us in Chriſt before the world was,</hi> that is, was then purpoſed, and in time exhibited. It could not be given to us, as in our ſelves conſidered: but when God gave us to Chriſt, and Chriſt to us, he gave us himſelf, and Grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in him, and by him: that as the Head of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, being in our room, and undertaking for our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The Father made him the Treaſurer and Diſpenſer of al Grace and Mercy, to give life to them, that he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his hand, betruſted as his Charge, and bequeathed unto his care.</p>
                  <p>As he takes away al Impediments on Gods part, that his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:66082:120"/>wrath and juſtice wil not hinder: So al on our parts, they cannot hinder: that though our corruptions would oppoſe, and our ſelves, being dead, could not receive it; He is a quickning ſpirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. <hi>Job,</hi> 36.10. He commands us to turn, and gives by his command. He makes the dead hear his voice, and makes us live who hear. Col. 1.13. <hi>He tranſlates us from Darkneſs into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>

                  <p>It ſerves to ſettle our jugdment in many truths of the Lords, which at this day are much queſtioned, and many cavils raiſed by carnal minds and hearts to oppoſe and darken; we may hence have undeniable evidence to convince and quiet our own minds and hearts, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods counſel therein.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts, Pelagians, Arminians, al the Popiſh Schools diſpute; whether God gives ſufficient Grace and power to al men, to be ſaved if they wil?</p>
                  <p>Whether Gods election iſſues out of his meer good wil and pleaſure, or from the previſion and foreſight of faith and good works? and they determine affermatively, unto both theſe.</p>
                  <p>Which deluſions notwithſtanding are fully daſhed by the former Doctrins. If God give ſufficient help to al indifferently to be ſaved, to <hi>Judas</hi> as to <hi>Peter:</hi> Then he gives al into the hand, and commends al unto the care of Chriſt. For this is a principal Grace and favor, and an eſpecial means of life, without which it cannot be attained.</p>
                  <p>But this God doth not beſtow upon al. For al that God gives to Chriſt, certainly come to him by Faith: for al ſuch he prayes, they ſhal be with him in glory. But al do not come to him by beleeving, al ſhal not be with him in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi> If coming unto Chriſt be an effect of giving,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66082:121"/>unto Chriſt an effect of Election. <hi>I pray for thoſe thou haſt given me, becouſe they are thine:</hi> Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord Jeſus is, as I may ſo ſay, fond of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and therefore he is not willing to be in Heaven, unleſs they may be with him: as though Heaven were no Heaven, unleſs the Saints ſhould take up their abode there.

                  <p>In this Second Particular there be Three Points eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially obſerveable.</p>
                  <p>One which is the Foundation of the reſt, is taken, as a thing granted, upon which ground the Prayer is made, To Wit, <hi>The preſence of Chriſt and the glory of which Chriſt ſtands poſſeſſed;</hi> Theſe are things ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, only the Queſtion ariſeth, why Chriſt ſo earneſtly deſires their injoyment of his preſence, ſince now they had it, converſing with him, and he with them.</p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:66082:121"/>
                  <p>What preſence therefore doth our Savior intend? or what is the glory here meant? <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, our Savior was now preſent with them, and they with him, and therefore that is not the thing he principally aimes at: but he looks at his own being in Heaven, which was immediately to ſucceed his death; and he ſpeaks of it, as a thing paſt, becauſe of the infallible certainty thereof. As it is the uſual courſe of Scripture, in the like caſe, ſo to expreſs things. Rev. 18.2. <hi>Babylon is fallen, its fallen.</hi> It was to be undoubtedly, and therefore he ſpeaks of it, as done certainly.</p>
                  <p>It was impoſſible that any thing ſhould hinder our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior from coming thither, and therefore he takes it as a thing done, That he is, as though he were certainly there already: <hi>q. d.</hi> I am now going to my death, and grave, and thence to riſe again, and go to Heaven, and I am deſirous they ſhould be there alſo, I am not willing to be without them. And by conſequence, the glory he mentions is the glory of Heaven. For ſhould we look at his <hi>Preſent</hi> condition, it was the time of his <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and the very ſeaſon of his greateſt abaſement was growing on, when he was to undertake his ſufferings and <hi>to empty himſelf of his glory. Philip.</hi> 2.7. He is ſaid to make <hi>himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the forme of a ſervant, humbled himſelf unto the death of the Croſs;</hi> and as his preſent ſtate was the time of his abaſement: So his ASCENSION is called the time of his <hi>Glory,</hi> becauſe that great diſcovery of his glory was reſerved for that ſeaſon, and was then made manifeſt.

For however it pleaſed the Lord, out of his infinite love, to ſtep out of the Chair of Eſtate, to viſite this inferior world, to be included in the Womb of a Virgin, and to take his progreſs into theſe lowermoſt parts of the Earth: yet it carried no proportion, in point of honor, that he ſhould take up his abode there, but to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

This is that which the Apoſtle intimates to be the ground of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the advancment of the poſterity of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> above the firſt. The Faithful ſhal be raiſed and Tranſlated from Earth to Heaven: whereas, ad <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in Paradiſe, he and his poſterity had injoyed an earthly paradiſe, that is, God there only; and the reaſon is rendred from the point in hand. 2 Cor. 15.45. <hi>The firſt man was a living Soul;</hi> able to beget one like himſelf, by a natural courſe of generation. <hi>But the ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>was a quickning Spirit,</hi> able to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66082:123"/>give life to the dead, and ſo raiſe up them from the Grave, and to make them ſpiritual Bodies, which was beyond the power of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>The firſt man is of the Earth, earthy:</hi> His covenant, and his countenance ſuch. <hi>But the ſecond is the Lord from Heaven.</hi> And thence he infers, <hi>As is the heavenly, ſuch are they that are heavenly:</hi> Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the main point of reſurrection, whereof now he diſputes. And as in reſurrection, ſo in aſcenſion,</p>
                  <p>That which firſt belongs to the Lord Jeſus, as the Head of the covenant, that belongs to al through him and only by him.</p>
                  <p>But our aſcending and ſitting is the prerogative Royal of our Savior, therefore it never did, nor ſhould have belonged to any but through and by him.</p>
                  <p>Its true our Savior conſiſts of two Natures, <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human;</hi> but becauſe the humanity is the meaner and more inferiour, therefore that muſt follow the Deity, and be where it is: And we alſo, whoſe Nature our Savior took, and whoſe places and perſons he ſuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ained, we muſt follow our Nature, and our Nature the God Head, that hath his proper place in Heaven: And therefore the Human Nature with that, and all thoſe, who are the members of that Head, muſt be there where the Head is.</p>
                  <p>And hence our Savior profeſſeth for the comfort of his diſciples, <hi>That he went before to prepare a place for them.</hi> Joh. 14.4. <hi>In my Fathers Houſe there be many manſions, I go to prepare a place for them.</hi> He as God-man, the Head of the Covenant, goes to Heaven: and the wil bring al his to Heaven: by vertue thereof, he makes way for them thither, Room and entertainment there. Heaven is the Lords: the place of the God-Head: our Nature aſſumed follows that, and we our Nature.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66082:123"/>He is ſent as an Ambaſſador from the Father, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the work of Redemption, <hi>And to bring</hi> Jacob <hi>back again:</hi> And therefore in reaſon, he muſt return, and give an account unto God the Father, how the great Affaires of Redemption proſper under his hand. Thus he ſpeaks uſually. Joh. 13.3. <hi>Jeſus Knowing,</hi> that is, conſidering this, That the Father had given al things into his hands, and that he came from God, and was to go to God, he forthwith addreſſeth himſelf to make way for his death, wherein the great weight of the work lay. <hi>q. d.</hi> He had received his commiſſion from the Father, and he muſt give account to the Father again. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he intimates his departure. Joh. 7.33. <hi>Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that is ſent of an errand and ſervice, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an account of the ſucceſs, and how things proſper under his hand, and by his indeavor. Els there ſhould be a failing in the faithful diſcharge of his Office, and that is the reaſon, the Lord Jeſus is ſo punctual in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. <hi>Loe here am I, and the Children that thou haſt given me. And of thoſe that thou haſt given me, I have not loſt one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its alſo the manner of great commanders, when they go upon great exploits and ſpecial ſervice, though they conquer other people, poſſeſs the places and countries where they pervail; yet they return into their native and natural Country, there to be honored amongſt their own, and to have their greatneſs <hi>Admired</hi> amongſt them, as <hi>Feared</hi> amongſt the <hi>Adverſaries.</hi> So it was with our Savior, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His death was his conquering, his reſurrection his triumph; by his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he returned into his own Countrey and his ſitting at the right hand of God the Father is there crowned with the fulneſs of all glory, that is compatible to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a created Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The efficacy of the Priviledg, as that which ſo
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66082:124"/>much concernes the ſpiritual and eternal welfare of al the faithful, requires this of neceſſity to appertain to him, that muſt procure our good.</p>
                  <p>So our Savior reaſons to quiet the hearts of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, becauſe of his departure. Joh. 16.7. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I tell you the truth, it is expedient I ſhould go away, for if I go not away, the comforter wil not come, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you.</hi> They could hardly beleeve it, as that which carried the face and appearance of any propability with it: that our Savior puts out of queſtion; know it of a truth, which upon trial ye wil find to be certain. Ye would conceive at the ſudden puſh, that there could be nothing more inconvenient and croſs to the furtherance of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: But its expedient. Hence thoſe phraſes, <hi>The Spirit was not yet given, becauſe Chriſt was not yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended.</hi> Al the gift of the Spirit was in vertue of that work, and the further perfection of that in Chriſt, the further communication of al from Chriſt. Now our Savior is far above al principalities and powers, beyond the power, nay the oppoſing preſence, nay the leaſt appearance of any hinderance, that may be caſt in the way by Satan, to prejudice or ſtop the work of our Redemption by Chriſt for us, or the work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Chriſt in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is the only proper cauſe and immediate ſpring of the <hi>Application of ſpiritual good:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had he not riſen, our Faith had been in vain: for as his death purchaſed right unto al, ſo did his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection make Application of it: for by that he reſcued himſelf, and ſo us his members then in him from the power of darkneſs: that though they purſued, yea crucified Chriſt, could not overcome him, but he roſe again. But when he aſcends, he was then beyond the aſcent of his enemies, yea beyond the fight, the ſhew, the appearance, of temptation. <hi>Far above.</hi> And ſo when we ſhal be made to aſcend, we ſhal be like to our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66082:124"/>Savior, and he freed from the annoyance, the ſhew, or appearance of evil. Hence obſerve the Apoſtle his Connexion; He hath aſcended on high, he led Captivity captive. Hell, Sin, and Death, were like a miſerable captived company, that now were under the Spear, durſt not huſh, nor ſtir: <hi>He then gives Gifts to men.</hi> When Chriſt was crowned Emperor over al the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then he ſends his royal Gifts, Coronation Mercies abroad.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is for the great Contentment, and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Savior, <hi>John,</hi> 14.28. <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go to my Father, for my Father is greater than I.</hi> Any Preferment puts us into Places, which are above our own ordinary. Now there is none greater than Chriſt, but the Father; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to go with him, and be with him, is the higheſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>

                  <p>Therefore they who have made choyce of a Chriſt, have no cauſe to be aſhamed. If he were a baſe Chriſt, ye might have ſome color to ſeek another, to make a change: but it's not ſo. But though he went from the Croſs to the Grave, yet he went from thence to Heaven, and there is now in the higheſt Honor. His ſuffering was but his entring into Glory, nay, the addition to his Glory: therefore that ſhould not ſo much diſcourage, as content, and cauſe us to bleſs God for our Portion.</p>
                  <p>A dead Savior was better to <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> than his life: his reproaches better than the riches of the World to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, when he is exalted in Heaven, attended by Angels, received into Glory, advanced to the right hand of his Father; what madneſs is it now, to think we could once have done better? The Crown of Thorns which our Savior wore, was to be choſen before the Credit of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66082:125"/>the World; what ſhould we judg of the Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? The Poverty of Chriſt, is better than the Wealth of the World; the Shame of Chriſt, better than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the World; the Contempt, and Humiliation of a Chriſt, better than the greateſt Pomp and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Earth can attain. How much more ſhould our hearts be comforted, and ſatisfied now, with the Honor, Life, Happineſs, and Heaven, where our Savior now is, upon whom ye have truſted, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?

                  <p>If the Head be above Water, the Body cannot be drowned, though it be under Water. Chriſt is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he wil never leave his Members in Hell, nor Grave. So that a man may boldly, and comfortably conclude: He wil make this ſick, and weak Body, like to his glorious Body; this ſinful Soul, like unto his, in al Holineſs, and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>As Chriſt of himſelf, thou mayeſt in Chriſt bear up thy ſelf againſt the Gates of Hel. Behold, I was dead, and live for evermore, and have the Keys of Hell and Death. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. Behold, I was dead in my ſins, ſunk in my diſtreſſes, overborn with diſtempers, and temptations; but I ſhal be for ever comforted, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, delivered for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ye have the Promiſe and Engagement of our Savior. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live,</hi> John, 14.19. <hi>He is far above all Principalities and Powers,</hi> and we ſhal be as he is. He hath not only promiſed what he wil do; but he is gone on purpoſe to make way for us, to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:66082:125"/>prepare a place for us, and to bring us thereunto. So he chears the hearts of his Diſciples, <hi>John,</hi> 14.2, 3. He deals truly, and faithfully, and tenderly with us: If it were not ſo, he would have told us. He is gone on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make room, and to ſee that al things be ready. And if we know not the way, nor can help our ſelves in it; he profeſſeth, <hi>he will come again.</hi> When we are and ſtands, he wil again ſupport us; when we are foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and overborn with Temptations, he wil again deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, <hi>and receive us to himſelf;</hi> though caſt out of Earth, and Societies of men, he wil receive us to himſelf, ſhelter us under his wings, put us into his own boſom, caſt up the reckoning that the Apoſtle doth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>He dieth no more, death hath no more Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him, &amp;c.</hi> Reckon ye alſo, ſhal I yield to my Corruptions?

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It commonly, and uſually implies three things in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The world and excellency</hi> that is in any thing, whereby it obtains Superiority and Eminency, above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of meaner quality and condition. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cals the Graces given to us in <hi>Adam, Our Glory,</hi> Rom. 3.23. <hi>We have all ſinned, and are deprived of the Glory of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We are transformed from one degree of Glory, unto another;</hi> that is, of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Grace. Thus we cal a man of ſpecial, Spiritual Abilities, a glorious Chriſtian, an eminent Chriſtian. So in verſe 22. foregoing, <hi>The Glory thou gaveſt me, I have given to them.</hi> So it is ſaid, Joh. 1.14. <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Glory of Chriſt</hi> (what that is, he ads and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates) <hi>full of Grace and Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Expreſſions,</hi> or putting forth of ſuch Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the moſt eminent, and choice Operations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, becauſe in ſuch Actions, the luſtre and beauty of all ſuch excellencies ſhines forth, and diſcovers it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are termed the Glory of any thing. Thus <hi>Acts,</hi> 22.11. The ſhine of the Light that compaſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> is called, <hi>The Glory of the Light.</hi> The luſtre, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty which appeared upon <hi>Moſes</hi> Face, when he came from the Mount, is called, <hi>The Glory of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. And that beauty of the Light of the Sun, whereby it out-bids the reſt of the other Stars, is called, <hi>The Glory of the Sun,</hi> I Cor. 15.41. And when our Savior raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66082:127"/>of that power, he cals, <hi>The Glory of God,</hi> John, 11.40. <hi>Said I not unto thee, if thou would'ſt beleeve, thou ſhould'ſt ſee the Glory of God?</hi> that is, the glorious expreſſion of Gods Power, and it's the beſt and only explication of that place, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>They ſhall be deſtroyed from the glory of his power;</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and utmoſt expreſſion of Gods power ſhal put forth it ſelf in the deſtruction of the ungodly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The acknowledgment of all theſe Excellencies,</hi> and of al the expreſſions thereof, in al the eminencies that are diſcovered therein. This is <hi>Glory.</hi> And thus we are ſaid to give glory to God or Man, in ſuch acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments which are ſuitable and agreeable in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the worth of the things. <hi>My Son, give Glory to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Senſe is moſt properly intended in this place. The firſt is not altogether excluded, but in part only conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>In what reſpect is Glory attributed to Chriſt, as God, or Man, or both?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is given to the Perſon of the Son, both as God and Man, now ſitting at the right hand of God the Father.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Glory which no meer Creature is capable of, that muſt appertain to him that is more than a Creature, and in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But of this Glory, no meer Creature is capable: For it's ſuch a glorious power which he poſſeſſeth, and which is here underſtood, whereby he ſubdues al things, even death, unto himſelf. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. laſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This alſo is evident, by the Queſtion which our Savior Chriſt makes, and the Argument he brings for the evidencing and evincing this Senſe, that indeed he was God as wel as man, and that this Glory of his exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66082:127"/>did in that behalf; belong to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.42, 43. He asked the Phariſees, <hi>What think ye of Chriſt the Meſſias, whoſe Son is he? They ſay unto him, the Son of David,</hi> that is, they looked at him, as meer man: Againſt which he thus reaſons; <hi>How then doth</hi> David <hi>in ſpirit call him Lord? In Spirit,</hi> that is, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate and direction of the Holy Ghoſt, as Mark, 12.36. <hi>The Lord,</hi> that is, God, <hi>ſaid unto my Lord,</hi> that is, unto my Seed, which is my Lord, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine Enemies thy Footſtool.</hi> Now if his Son, how is he his Lord?</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Davids</hi> Seed, be <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, then <hi>Davids</hi> Seed is more than meer Man. For if he had been meer Man, the Child is inferior, and ſubject to the Father, is not Lord over the Father; as it's ſaid, He was ſubject to his Parents. But <hi>Davids</hi> Seed, is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, and therefore more than meer Man. As Chriſt is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Lord, ſo is he exalted: for it's ſo affirmed, ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him; <hi>He ſaid to my Lord, ſit at my right hand.</hi> But as God, he is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord; therefore as God, he is exalted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It's plain alſo by that Prayer, and Expreſſion of our Savior, <hi>John,</hi> 17.5. Father, <hi>Glorifie me thy ſelf, with that Glory which I had with thee, before the World was.</hi> Now that muſt needs be the Glory which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain unto him, as God: For his Humane Nature was not before the World; and therefore did not, nor could not partake of any Glory. And hence it is undeniable, it muſt be meant of that Glory which he had before the World was, and did in the Phraſe, and according to the meaning of the Scripture, lay aſide, in the daies of his Humiliation, and abaſement in the form of a Servant, and did now aſſume, when he aſcended, and while now he ſits at the right hand of God the Father.</p>
                  <p>That Glory which he had before the World was, muſt be a Glory belonging to the God-head.</p>
                  <p>But that which our Savior deſires, and according to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66082:128"/>his deſire; obtains in his Aſcention and Glorification in Heaven, is that which he had before the World, and therefore it doth appertain to his God-head.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As this Glory belongs to him or God; ſo as Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe this glorious Power is executed by him, as Man now aſcending and ſitting in Heaven: So that his Man-hood doth concur, as an Inſtrument working with his God-head, in the adminiſtration of it, <hi>John,</hi> 5.27. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath given all power to the Son, to execute Judgment,</hi> in as much as he is the Son of Man, that is, Becauſe the Humane Nature is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed into perſonal Union, and therein he hath ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, and ſo purchaſed Redemption, and ſo al the power, as that being the only way, by which this Redemption purchaſed, comes to be applied to the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Wherein this Glory conſiſts, which is thus attributed to the Perſon of our Savior?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the right underſtanding of this Third Particular, wherein the pith, and life of the Point lies, This is a Rule that muſt be premiſed, and carefully car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with us in our thoughts, as that which wil guide through the following Explication, namely, That Glory is here to be attended in the ſeveral Branches of it, which the Lord Chriſt did lay aſide by voluntary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, out of his own free wil, and mutual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God the Father, <hi>Glorifie me with the Glory I had with thee.</hi>

                  <p>That which was laid aſide by him, that may be taken up again, and given to him, by the ſame Agreement.</p>
                  <p>And hence all thoſe infinite Excellencies that are in God, the abſolute might of Soveraignty over the Creature, is not properly any part of Glory, unto which he was exalted. Becauſe this is a property of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66082:128"/>Nature, and ſo doth neceſſarily appertain to every perſon that hath this Nature, as neceſſarily as to be God. This he had of his own, and this could not be given to him, nor laid aſide by him. And this was the firſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of glory before mentioned. But our Savior by voluntary diſpenſation did lay aſide the right of preſent-taking Dominion, and exerciſing Dominion, over every creature in that Nature he did aſſume. And hence Satan and his inſtruments, he in and by them, did not only aſſault our Savior by their outrages and temptations, but by violence of power did out-bid, and over-bear him for the preſent. Thus, as it were with a violent hand, he carried him into the Wilderneſs, and ſet him upon a Pinacle of the Temple: yea not only aſſaulted, but prevailed and had the better for the preſent, brought him to his death, and held him captive in the grave by the ſpace of three daies: Our Savior by agreement with God the Father laying aſide and cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Hence are theſe paſſages, <hi>This is your hour and the power of darkneſs. Luk.</hi> 22.53. <hi>q. d.</hi> This is the time, when ye have allowance to Tirannize, and I wil not exerciſe dominion over you (for he could have croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and confounded with a word) but ſuffer my ſelf to be foiled for the preſent and held captive by you. This is the power of darkneſs, when I lay aſide the exerciſe and expreſſing of my power. Hence he returned that anſwer. <hi>Knoweſt thou not, that I could but ask my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he would give me more than twelve. Legions of Angels, but how then ſhould the Scripture be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled?</hi> That agreement that was tranſacted between me and the Father, and now recorded in Scripture. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.53. Hence its ſaid, <hi>Though he was in the form of God:</hi> Had the might and ſoveraignty of God,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66082:129"/>and was equal in that with the Father, had it as his own, without any robbery, or taking that which was not his right; <hi>Yet he emptied himſelf:</hi> Laid aſide the Right ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of taking or exerciſing that power.

Thus our Savior laid aſide his glory.</p>
                  <p>Now the Father gives and he aſſumes glory to himſelf,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that he freed him from the former Tiranny and power of darkneſs, and exalted him, far above al prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, and what there is named in this or another world. Beyond al Gunſhot, not only beyond their power, but their aſſaults, yea their preſence and ſight.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that al power and Grace belongs to him in way and right of comunication for the good of his, therefore called Head of the Church. And this follows the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Mark the Coherence; He hath exalted him, and given him to be Head <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For had not the ſecond perſon ſuffered and ſatisfied, there had never been way nor right to communicate Grace to his, or to improve of ſet on going the power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God for his. And therefore its his propriety to be Head, not the Father, nor the ſpirit. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. To have life of himſelf. And verſe, 21. To quicken whom he wil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And immediate diſpenſation and execution of al power over al creatures, for the bringing home of his Elect. Thus the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed al to him: not that the Father hath not power for the execution of the work: for he that gives it hath it in a principal manner: but he hath committed
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66082:129"/>the immediate execution thereof unto Chriſt. 1 Cor. 11.3. The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of the Faithful, but of al. For that is the ſcope.</p>
                  <p>Theſe different degrees are to be attended in regard of Subordination, and immediate diſpenſation:</p>
                  <p>For, Head Implies
<list>
                        <item>Excellency and power to move all in Subordination to it.</item>
                        <item>Authority to rule al in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>So its not excellency, but power and authority, not at large, but in Subordination in the next and immediate diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence, he croſſeth and confoundeth al the power and Policy of al the enemies of his Church, brings to nought the rage of Devils and Malice of Men, and each inſtrument that is formed. Eph. 4. <hi>Being aſcended up on high, he led Captivity Captive.</hi> Nay makes them al ſerviceable to his Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. All is yours, and you Chriſts, and Chriſt Gods. This is the order. Chriſt is Gods Servant: and all your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence, he reſtores his Elect from the power of Darkneſs, and tranſlates them into the liberty of his own, by an invincible and irreſiſtable power, breaks in upon the rebellious heart of a ſinner, and brings him home unto himſelf. No man comes to the Father, but by me. Rev. 1.18. I <hi>was dead, and I am alive, and live for evermore, and I have the Keyes of Hell and Death.</hi> Joh. 10.16. <hi>I have other Sheep, that are not of this fold, and thoſe</hi> I <hi>muſt bring.</hi> He ſends and ſucceeds al Officers and ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence, from this immediate diſpenſation of al power, he ſends his ſpirit the Comforter into the hearts of his, that he may ſupply al their wants, furniſh them to al their works, and fit them with fulneſs of power and ſpirit to each holy performance. Its requiſite I go, becauſe If I go not, the Comforter wil not come: but if
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:66082:130"/>I go, I wil ſend him. The glorification of our Savior makes way for the miſſion of the Spirit and obſerve what he adds. Joh. 16.13, 14. <hi>He ſhall take of mine, and give it to you.</hi> And what wil he give? All things that the Father hath, and mine, therefore I ſaid, he ſhal take of mine. They are al Chriſts, for the immediate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and its from the vertue of a glorified Savior, that the ſpirit takes them, and conveies them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He gives unto his Eternal life. Joh. 17.2. <hi>Thou haſt given me al power over all fleſh, that I may give unto them eternal life;</hi> And this as the ſecond perſon in the former ſence. For as meer man, he gives not eternal life.</p>
                  <p>This is the end and Errand. And when this is done, then he profeſſeth, He hath finiſhed the work, he gave him to do; when he hath gathered and glorified his Saints, he hath done al he hath to do in this world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>His Human Nature is made glorious,</hi>
                     <list>

                  <p>Upon this ground our Savior put theſe Fears to flight, when <hi>John</hi> fel at his feet as dead, in the ſenſe of his own vilenes &amp; the ſight of the dazelling excellencies of the Lord.

He ſaid, <hi>Feare not, I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I live for ever.</hi> I live as one that hath conquered, as one that hath triumphed over al Enemies, and have the Keyes of Hell and Death. So to his Diſciples. Joh. 14.27. <hi>Let not thy Heart be troubled,</hi> neither let it be afraid, not diſtracted, nay not ſtirred, Why? ye have heard, I ſaid unto you, I go away, and wil come again. That he goes to his Father, who is greater than he, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in glory; and with whom he was to poſſeſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of al glory in greateſt excellency: and therefore the hearing of this ſhould quit them of al Fears, quiet them of al diſmayings. He is now gone to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greateſt power that is in Heaven, that no power on Earth, Heaven or Hell, ſhould be able to hurt. And therefore we need not Fear.

But her Husband, whoſe name is written on his Thigh, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, appears in her quarrel.

Yea, it's the proviſion Chriſt makes, <hi>Touch not mine anointed:</hi> Nay, the portion of the Saints which the Lord Chriſt hath laid out from Heaven, and the Conqueſt he hath made, <hi>John,</hi> 16. laſt, <hi>Be of good comfort, I have overcome the World.</hi> Iſa. 54.17. <hi>No Weapon againſt thee ſhall prosper.</hi> This is the Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Gods Servants.</p>

Upon this ground, <hi>Paul</hi> flings out the Gantlet againſt al Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and there is not an Action that can paſs, nay, not ſo much as a motion made againſt him, that can find au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in Court, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of Gods Choſen? it's God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, nay, it's Chriſt that hath died, nay, rather riſen again, nay, ſits at the right hand of God.</hi> Juſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemn, Chriſt hath ſatisfied, and is freed, and now is at Gods right hand, and is at the better hand with Juſtice, triumphs there; Devils cannot cavil, they are ſilenced; Conſcience accuſe, that is anſwered; nay, thoſe dayly failings which might ſeem to interrupt the Terms of Agreement betwixt God and the Soul, and make new Controverſies: Theſe are taken up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted by the Lord Jeſus. Nay, the main Pith of this Glory was, as ye have read before, <hi>That the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate execution of Gods whol Counſel towards the Sons of Men, is by his means, comes through his hands.</hi> And if there be any thing againſt his Members, his Spouſe, he wil be ſure to ſtop that proceeding. So <hi>Paul</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>If reconciled by his Death, how much more ſhall we be ſaved by his Life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>By this all Graces ſhall be ſtrengthened, and made glorious;</hi> anſwerable, and in ſome meaſure proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Glory that Chriſt hath poſſeſſed. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives glorious Power and Grace to him, and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth glorious Grace and Power to us. This is the ground of the Inference; <hi>The Spirit was not ſent becauſe Chriſt was not aſcended.</hi> That the larger meaſure of the Spirit, in the more ſpiritual and efficacious operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, was not yet given, becauſe he was not yet in the Throne of Glory, and inveſted with the fulneſs of that power, which then he ſhould re-aſſume, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to himſelf. And this <hi>Peter</hi> renders to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe extraordinary Gifts that were given, and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66082:134"/>admirable Works that were done by the Apoſtles. When al the People wondered, and ſtood amazed, to hear each man ſpeak in his own language, the magnificent things of God; the holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> carries them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to the firſt root and riſe of al thoſe miraculous Diſpenſations, <hi>Acts,</hi> 2.34, 36. <hi>That Chriſt whom ye have crucified, God hath raiſed, and made him both Lord and Chriſt;</hi> and having received the Promiſe of the Spirit, having as man received the Spirit without meaſure, as much as Nature was capable of: and as God, poſſeſſed and recovered the ſame Glory, which he had with the Father, before al Worlds; <hi>He now ſheds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad this, which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> Great Princes reſerve the greateſt Gifts, and Entertainment, unto the daies of greateſt Solemnity, as Coronation, or Conqueſt. The day of Chriſts Aſcention, and ſitting, and ſo poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Glory, is the day of his Coronation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, returns into his own Country, and there tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, and then gives Gifts, enlargeth himſelf in the Graces of his Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 22, 23. when Chriſt was ſet in Heavenly places, and advanced to his Glory, <hi>It was that he might be Head of his Church, and might fill all in all.</hi> By this he comes to be Head, and hath all Graces: By this he comes to communicate himſelf, not in ſparing manner, but fully, and freely, he fils all in all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>By this thou mayeſt be enlarged in all Services;</hi> not only receive more Graces, but exerciſe what thou haſt received in a more active, and excellent manner, than ever otherwiſe thou ſhould'ſt, or could'ſt have attained unto. The Glory of our Savior over-ſhadowing thee, wil make thee pray gloriouſly, lead a glorious life, and perform glorious Duties. Thus our Savior diſputes, <hi>John,</hi> 14.22. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that beleeveth in me, ſhall do the Works that I do,</hi> that is, in regard of the Doctrine he then delivered, or Works he then wrought: <hi>Nay, greater works than theſe, ſhall he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66082:134"/>do;</hi> Why? Becauſe, <hi>I go to my Father.</hi> He goes to poſſeſs al Glory, in al the fulneſs of the Execution of al power and diſpenſation thereof. And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more, diſpenſeth more vertually, by the power of his ſitting at the right hand of God, than he did when he was bodily preſent in the daies of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Peter</hi> by the vertue of his death, and that glorious power which Chriſt poſſeſſed in Heaven, he converted at once, three thouſand, which our Savior never did while he preached. Chriſt healed the Sick, and cured Diſeaſes of ſuch as came to him; but <hi>Peter,</hi> ſuch as he ſent his Hand-kerchief unto. Nay, our Savior ads, <hi>Whatever ye ask in my Name,</hi> in the Name of Chriſt now in Glory, as he is gone to his Father: If ye ask any thing never ſo miraculous, hard, improbable, impoſſible to Fleſh and Blood, he wil bring it about. And upon this Tenure it is, that promiſe is made to the Church of <hi>Thyatira, That ſhe ſhall rule the Nations with a rod of Iron,</hi> Rev. 2.26, 27. A poor handful of People, the mighty, and invincible power of a multitude of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: See the Reaſon, it is, <hi>As I have received from my Father.</hi> This power of this glorious Diſpenſation, is ſuch as he hath received in a more ful, and eminent manner, he wil ſo alſo communicate it. And therefore our Savior profeſſeth, it is expedient that he ſhould go away; for if he go not, he wil not ſend the Comforter; but if he do, he wil ſend him, and then he ſhal lead you into all truth, <hi>John,</hi> 16.7.13. The laſt reſolution reſts there; Al is Chriſts that the Father hath, and he ſhal take of Chriſts, and give to them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>By this thou maieſt be ſure thou canſt not miſs of Eternal Life.</hi> This was the end why Chriſt receives, God the Father gives this Glory, that he may give it unto the Faithful, <hi>John,</hi> 17. <hi>Thou haſt given me pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all Creatures, that I may give unto them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life:</hi> Chriſt cannot miſs of his End, nor thou of Glory. And if al power can bring to Eternal Life, thou
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:66082:135"/>canſt not but enjoy it. Chriſt muſt fail of his intent, if thou fail of thy happineſs: and therefore you ſhal find our Savior ſo ſolicitous to ſettle the hearts of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in this, and himſelf ſo unweariable to accompliſh it, John, 14.2, 3. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, &amp;c.</hi> They were, and al the Saints find a hard ſhock here, they are troubled what wil become of them at laſt, and how ſhal they once arrive at the Haven, the ſtorms ſo ſtrong, the waves ſo fierce, oppoſitions from without ſo great, corruptions from within ſo out-ragious? Why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior ſaies, <hi>Be not troubled, I go to prepare a place.</hi> True, there be Manſions enough; but how hard to come at them? He anſwers, I wil come and bring you to my ſelf.</p>

As great Princes, when they wil advance any Perſon, whom they purpoſe to make a Favorite, they ſo contrive that all buſineſs muſt come through his hand, that al may eye him, honor him, and have dependance upon him. So it is with the Father: Chriſt is his Favorite, he hath ſo ordered it, that al muſt come through his hand, al from the Father by him, al through him returned to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So the Father profeſſeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>He hath given him a Name above all Names, that at his Name, all might bow.</hi> As therefore the Father deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,

                     <item>1 The Parties for whom Chriſt praies: ſuch as the Father had given him.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>Before we could come at the Second of theſe, there was one Point, which was ſuppoſed, and taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which makes way for al thoſe that follow: namely, That Chriſt was in Heaven, and did enjoy the fulneſs of Glory there, given him of the Father, and of both theſe, that is, both the Parts of the Point(
<list>
                        <item>1. That Chriſt is in Heaven.</item>
                        <item>2. That he is poſſeſſed of the fulneſs of Glory, by gift from the Father, at his right hand, both as Second Perſon, and as Mediator, God and Man, Redeemer of the World</item>
                     </list>)we have fully written.</p>
                  <p>And before we can proceed to the Second Thing, which was formerly propounded, and wherein the pith of the Prayer of our Savior appears, containing the main thing petitioned, we ſhal be enforced to take in the laſt clauſe of the Verſe, as being nothing elſe, but an ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the former Doctrine, and laies out unto us, the cauſe and reaſon whence it comes, that the Father gave, and Chriſt received this ſo great Glory.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Original, from whence this, ſo great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Glory proceeds, <hi>It is, from the Love of the Father, towards our Savior, his bleſſed Son.</hi> And that Love is not of yeſterday, nor of late, or in this laſt Age of the World occaſioned; but it iſſues out of <hi>his antient and everlaſting Lover,</hi> wherewith he imbraced
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66082:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Lord Jeſus, <hi>before the World was;</hi> and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed and brought to perfection, but before the firſt corner ſtone, before the Foundation thereof was laid.</p>
                  <p>I wil not give way to any curious Speculation; but I beleeve it's true, and I ſuppoſe it's ſuitable to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words, That the Father laid the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Love of his Son in his own heart and thoughts, in order of Nature, before in his everlaſting purpoſe he laid out in his contrivement, the firſt Pillars and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, upon which the World was founded. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands himſelf directly, al other; <hi>Quatenus ſui imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem gerunt.</hi> So Wiſdom ſeems to ſpeak, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. <hi>He poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his Works of old.</hi> The firſt beginning of Gods way, is to underſtand himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhal content our ſelves with that which is taken up with the currant, and common conſent of al. And then we have two Points.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Father loved his Son from everlaſting, before the Foundation of the World: And this we hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led formerly in the foregoing verſe, 23.</item>
                     <item>2. That which is of freſh Conſideration, unto which we ſhal ſpeak a few words very briefly, is, the force of Argument, or Reaſon here laid forth, viz. <hi>The everlaſting love wherewith the Father em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his Son, is the firſt cauſe why he gave him everlaſting Glory.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </div>

            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>The Eternal Glory of Chriſt, is a Gift of the Eternal Love of the Father.</head>
               <p>In grows out of this root, it iſſues firſtly out of this Fountain. Hither our Saviors thoughts ariſe, and here he reſts. This is the Crown of Glory, and the Diadem in the Crown; and the luſtre and ſhine of that is, <hi>The Love of the Father.</hi> To this our Savior aſcends, and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:66082:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this he ſatisfies himſelf, and he would lead al his, as afterwards we ſhal ſee. Had not the Father given him glory out of his love, glory it ſelf would never have given our Savior content. Nay Heaven and glory it ſelf had not been worth the loving nor having, unleſs the love of God were in them. That is the quinteſſence of al.</p>
               <p>We ſhal open ſhortly two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What we muſt underſtand this love to be.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>How this love is the cauſe of this glory.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">For the right diſcovery and diſcerning of this love, that we may come as neer the mind of our Savior and the meaning of the text, as we may, we ſhal with warines, in ſome doubtful Seas, ſound and caſt ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that we may find, where the Channel lies.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It cannot then be taken for the ſpiritual and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial fruits and effects of Gods love, which the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth to his, according to the good pleaſure of his wil, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks. Rom. 5.5. <hi>The love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts.</hi> This rather looks at the fountain, that thoſe ſtreames, for which <hi>Jude</hi> Prayes, <hi>Grace, Peace, and Love be multiplied. Jude.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. For this love is from eternity! ſo are not thoſe fruits and expreſſions: becauſe they are put forth in time.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Beſide, the glory of our Savior is one of thoſe fruits which are here ſaid to Iſſue from that love. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it doth vertually and ſummarily include thoſe ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual expreſſions, which makes way for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Somtime, the love of God is put by a Figurative ſpeech for Election, as that, in Rom. 9.13. Jacob <hi>have</hi> I <hi>Loved,</hi> that is, Elected, or ſet apart, to be the ſubject of the expreſſions of his love.</p>
               <p>And this alſo ſeems not to fit the place in hand, For it goes ſomwhat againſt the grain of the phraſe. The love in the former and following words, in the verſe before and after, leads us to another apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66082:137"/>and looks another way.</p>
               <p>Beſide, the aim of our Savior, and his expreſſion would perſwade one to think, that he eyes ſomthing in the Father, which in a peculiar manner relates to him. Not that which equally and indifferently belongs to the Holy Spirit and himſelf alſo, as that purpoſe of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth.</p>
               <p>Nor yet is this meaning ſo fully ſuitable to the ſenſe of the place and force of the Argument. For glory was given and doth appertain to our Savior, not as man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but as the Second perſon in the glorious Trinity as we opened, and gave in undeniable evidence thereof in the former Doctrine. As our Savior was the ſubject of this glory, which was given, ſo is he the ſubject of that love, which gives it.</p>
               <p>But that Election, properly ſo termed, ſhould be attributed to Chriſt, as the ſecond perſon, I do not remember that any Scripture evidenceth. Therefore in the.</p>
               <p>Third and laſt place, I do conceive, that this love is attributed to the Father, in a perſonal regard, and for the manner of it, it doth in a proper and peculiar ſort, appertain to him, and Iſſues from that inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate relation, that is betwixt the Father and the Son. The Father gives al to the Son, as Son. The Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes al to the Father, as Father. Nor a Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, but becauſe he hath a Son. Not Son. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God. But becauſe he hath a Father. And hence it is, they are ſaid to have an In-being each in other. <hi>Beleeveſt thou, that the Father is in me, and</hi> I <hi>in the Father?</hi> Joh. 14.8, 9. <hi>Thou in me, and</hi> I <hi>in thee, that they may be one, as we are one.</hi> And for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is, the Father is ſaid, To dwel in Chriſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon. Joh. 14.10. And that cannot in any propriety of ſpeech be ſaid of the Eſſence, becauſe that the perſon dwels not in the Eſſence. For relations make no impreſſion in the ſubject.</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:66082:137"/>
               <p>Hence it is, the Lord Jeſus becomes the object of his Father love: his heart wholly affects, his thoughts are wholly ſet upon him, taken up with him. An infinite and eternal Favorite of an infinite and eternal Father. Called, the expreſs Character of his Fathers perſon. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. No ſuch likeneſs. No ſuch Love. So that he cannot once look off from him, Enamoured with him, and with an infinite fulneſs of Soul-pleaſing ſatisfaction, takes contentment in him. Hence our Savior profeſſeth Prov. 8.30. <hi>I was dayly his Delight.</hi> The Original word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>So the Father doth gaze upon the infinite beauty of his own image in his Son, beſtows his affection wholly upon him, and holds him to himſelf for ever.</p>
               <p>The Father and the Son being ſubſiſtences of the ſame Eſſence, they are one with another, in regard of the Eſſence, unto which they be adjoined, and one in another in regard of the perſonal relation that is betwen them: they are the delight one of another, and glorifie each other continually. The iſſue then is, In that the Father eyes, affects, delights in his Son, as the brightneſs of his Glory, the expreſs image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as his only begotten, bearing his ſimilitude and likeneſs, in an unconceivable and unmatchable reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance: This love in this manner, is proper to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the fountain and firſt cauſe of that glory the Lord Jeſus had with the Father, before the world was, and the firſt cauſe whence that glory comes to be reſtored, after he had emptied himſelf of his glory, and ſuffered the ſhameful death of the Croſs. Father glorifie me with thy ſelf, with the ſame glory that I had with thee, before the world was. And hence it is, our Savior is ſaid to be in the boſom, and to come from his boſom.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:66082:138"/>He lay in the boſom of his love, and from thence was ſent to reveal thoſe boſom ſecrets of the riches of his free love and Grace, which Els had never ſeen Sun.</p>
               <p>This is the love wherewith the Father loved the Son, before the world: and this love is the cauſe, why he gave him that glory. And that appears by a double Reaſon.</p>

                  <head>REAS. I.</head>
                  <p>Love laies out it ſelf for the behoof and benefit of the thing beloved, as much as may be, for the furtherance of the good of it to the utmoſt of that perfection its able to contrive, and the other able to receive; ſaies not in wiſhes, but is active and working, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires only in a kind of complementing formality, but really procures, what may be moſt uſeful for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the thing beloved. <hi>Let us not love in word and Tongue only,</hi> 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>The love of the Father being of greateſt excellency, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of unconceivable vertue &amp; efficacy, &amp; our Savior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of unmatchable likeneſs to draw out the love of the Father, and incomparable worth to deſerve it, it could not be, but ſo great love ſhould give the greateſt good to one of greateſt deſert: and therefore muſt give him that incomprehenſible glory, which might be the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the hearts of men and Angels, through al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Behold here is the incomprehenſible glory of the ever bleſſed Son, given out of the unconceivable love of the Father of glory. Hence the Evangeliſt, Joh. 3.35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> In love there is no lack; and its boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; and ſtudies the advancement of the thing beloved: So <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David.

                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:66082:138"/>
                  <p>And however it cannot ſtand with the glory of the Father, that his Son ſhould be above him, yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for eminency of honor anſwerable to his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

                  <p n="2">2. Love is of a cementing Nature, deſires union and neerneſs with the thing beloved, is not pleaſed nor ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied but with the preſence of that, which it doth affect: ſeeks the fellowſhip, ſociety, and company of that in a ſpecial manner. Its the guiſe of the Spouſe that is ſick of Love, when ſhe went to ſeek her Savior. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.

Ruth.</hi> 1.16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Now the love of the Father, being of infinite purity and perfection, muſt needs have like proportionable operation: and therefore muſt not only affect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Son, but muſt provide for the injoyment of it, in the neereſt and fulleſt communication of himſelf, that may be: and hence, as he came out of his boſom, and left his glory: ſo alſo he muſt bring him unto glory, that he may again lie in the boſom of his love. This our Savior intimates. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.3. Knowing that the Father gave al things into his hand, and that he came from God, and went to God: he came from the Father for the accompliſhment of the great Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he furniſhed him with the ſupply of al power, and al proviſion, al things in Heaven and Earth, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, until he come again to him; and when he is come into Heaven: as he put the greateſt glory upon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:66082:139"/>him, ſo he advanceth him to the neereſt familiarity with himſelf. <hi>By his right hand he hath exalted him. Act.</hi> 2.33. And ſet him at his right hand.

That he might make him ful of joy with his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that the Eye &amp; ſmiling countenance of the Father might ever be upon him, and fulneſs of the perfection of joy in him for ever.</p>
                  <p>If glory carry with it the greateſt perfection that can attend our Savior, and neereſt union unto the Father, then the love of the Father wil provide it. But glory includes both greateſt perfection in regard of Chriſt, and neereſt union unto the Father. Therefore the love of the Father wil provide for it.</p>

As it is in prime, cordial quinteſſences, if they be made of lively ingredients, they do not only warm the Mouth and heat the Stomach a little, but they ſearch into al the Veins, clear al the paſſages, Purg al the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and cleanſe the Blood, that the Body is recovered to a lively and healthful conſtitution: But if it warm a little overly, and work no further, we conclude it, Its not the right, it hath not the right work. So with thy love, if it be like the love of God, it wil have the like work; It aimes ever at the glorious good of the thing or perſon beloved; ſtaies not in theſe lower and inferior things, but in and by theſe, looks at thoſe which be higher, and of a more heavenly excellency.</p>
                  <p>Take then a Survey of the ſeveral operations of thy love according to the ſeveral occaſions, with which it

What doth it work in the family, where thou liveſt, in the place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thy neighbours with whom thou dwelleſt, with thy Brethren who are linked to thee, and thou to them in the fellowſhip of the Faith?

                  <p>In thy family thou caſteſt up and down how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the things of this life, and art marvailous buſie to contrive al earthly conveniences to thine own content. Thou ſeekeſt what to Eat, to Drink, what to put on, and obtaineſt what thou ſeekeſt, and thy love looks no further. Surely its worldly love, and that in the loweſt degree.

Thou dealeſt courteouſly with thoſe, who ſhew Kindneſs to thy ſelf, yieldeſt repect to mens places, honoreſt their perſons, carrieſt thy ſelf honeſtly and inoffenſively towards al. This love is no great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, do not the Publicans and ſinners the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Nay, it may be, thou doſt incourage men in a good courſe and ſtrengtheneſt their hearts and hands in the profeſſion or the Goſpel: laboureſt for ſome knowledg of the truth, and ablities to holy ſervices, that thou maieſt carry out thy profeſſion with applauſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of ſuch, with whom thou doſt converſe.

               <p>I ſay, he affectionately deſires, and that appears in his expreſſion, I WILL: Which implies Three Things in this place, as thus uſed.</p>
               <p n="1">That it is thing which ſuits the heart of the Lord Chriſt, and which he chuſeth, as a thing, that is wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him. This is as he would have it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he preſents the efficacy of his Merits, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience before God the Father; and by vertue of the Covenant and Agreement betwixt him and the Father tranſacted, touching his Elect and Choſen, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Recovery, he hath undertaken: and he challengeth, and claimeth at the hands of the Father, the enjoyment of Heaven, and Happineſs, which he hath purchaſed for his Servants the Faithful, and his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, and their preſence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He earneſtly requeſts, and praies unto the Father for the accompliſhment, and performance of this.</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:66082:141"/>
               <p>The firſt and laſt of theſe Particulars, ye have fully declared by the ſame word, as uſed upon the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When our Savior was to enter into his Agony in the Garden, a little before he was betrayed, he prayed more earneſtly, ſaies the Text; <hi>If it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs;</hi> and in the cloſe, ends and iſſues al with this ſubjection, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Marth. 26.39. that is, according to the Rules of Nature, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I would chuſe, and do deſire mine own preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as man: yet as Mediator, having undertaken the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mine, I ſubmit my Wil and Prayers to thy good pleaſure, and purpoſe. And for the Second Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it's thus alſo plain: Becauſe his Prayer is one part of his Prieſtly Office, and of that Interceſſion, which he makes for his redeemed ones: and that appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, in this; As he purchaſed, ſo in a righteous way he may obtain, the performance of al that good from the Father in the behalf of his; That they may be with them, and happy in them for ever, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. He ſhal ſee the travel of his Soul, he ſhal ſee the fruit of his dying and praying, the bringing of his unto God the Father into Heaven, and their bleſſedneſs there. And this our Savior doth not as man only, but as <hi>God-man, the Mediator of his Elect,</hi> as he volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſubmitted to the place of a Surety, and became a Servant for our ſakes, and ſo leſs than the Father, <hi>John</hi> 14.30. <hi>The Father is greater than I.</hi> Look as his Complaint, ſo his Prayer, may be conceived, as iſſuing and proceeding from the ſame ground. But when he complains, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> he was not forſaken of God, by the withdrawing of the ſence and ſweetneſs of his Favor, as man only, but as Surety; therefore as Mediator, and therefore ſo he prayed, and ſo was heard then, and now alſo heard and accepted of God the Father.</p>
               <p>And this affectionate deſire of our Savior, appears in this; That as he cannot take content in Heaven, unleſs
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66082:142"/>he have his Faithful with him: So he wil not reſt in Heaven, but wil come again to fetch them to him. <hi>John</hi> 14.3. <hi>I will come again, and take you to my ſelf.</hi> He hath betrothed his Bride and Spouſe here, and he wil come (as ſomtimes Princes and States come from their own Places and Kingdoms) with the great retinue of his Courtiers, and attendance of glorious Angels, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſhal go before him, and thouſand thouſands ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring to him, at the Solemnization of the day of Marriage; and he ſhal ſay, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi>

               <div type="reason">
                  <head>REASON.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby the Scope and End of the great Work of Reſtitution of loſt man, is in part, and in an eſpecial part thereof attained. This is the end of the Death and offering of our Savior, <hi>Heb,</hi> 9.7, 8. But into the Second, went the High-Prieſt alone, once every Yeer, not without Blood; the Holy Ghoſt thus ſignifying, That the way into the Holy of Holies, (that is, into Heaven) was not yet made manifeſt, while the firſt Tabernacle was ſtanding: but verſe 11. <hi>Chriſt being come an High Prieſt of good things to come, not by the blood of Goats, but by his own Blood, he entred once into the Holy Place</hi> (that is, Heaven) <hi>having obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for us.</hi> So that we have boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt of the Blood of Jeſus, by a new, and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us through the Vail, that is, his Fleſh. This is the Scope of his Reſurrection and Aſcention, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe, there be many Manſions, I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> that is, He aſcended into Heaven, that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:66082:142"/>by vertue of his Aſcention, we alſo might ariſe, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, and ſit in Heavenly places with him. For Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth firſtly appertain to our Savior; and from him, as our Head, it is communicated to us, as his Members. Had not the Second <hi>Adam</hi> aſcended, for ought I can ſee, no Son of <hi>Adam</hi> had ever come into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>When the laſt Enemy, which is Death, is vanquiſhed, and that he hath brought al the Elect home, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to God the Father; <hi>Here am I, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that thou haſt given me; then he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father.</hi> The Rule and Government of our Savior, in al theſe outward Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, ſhal be at an end. The end and ſcope of the Death, and Obedience, Aſcention, and Redemption wrought out by Chriſt, that he muſt affectionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But this is ſo. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this means, the perfection of his Body myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and himſelf as myſtical Chriſt, is accompliſhed; without this, ſomthing would be wanting, to make up the fulneſs thereof. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. laſt, It's ſaid of the Church (and is true of each Member for their meaſure) <hi>It is the fulneſs of him, who filleth all in all:</hi> the hearts of al his Saints, with al ſaving Graces. If at the laſt day of that great aſſembling of the firſt-born, there ſhould be but the pooreſt Saint wanting, and out of the way, the myſtical Body of Chriſt, would ſo far want it's fulneſs: if a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or a joynt be lacking, the Body would lack ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its ful integrity. And therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. God never leaves ſending Officers, they never leave ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, and perfecting the Body of Chriſt, until we all arrive and meet at the unity of Faith, and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Son of God. The Head and Members ſhould in reaſon be preſent one with another. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife in comlineſs, ſhould co-habit in the ſame place, and dwel together. Chriſt is the Head, his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful his Members; Chriſt the Husband is gone into his own, out of fair Countrey; and therefore he cannot but
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:66082:143"/>affectionately deſire the coming of his Bride unto him. Nay, rather than fail, as we heard, he wil come down from Heaven, and fetch her. <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>I will take you to my ſelf, that where I am, ye may be alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The compleat happineſs of the Saints, can only by this means be fully procured.</p>
                  <p>The Lord redeems, not only from guilt, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and power of our ſins and miſeries, but even from the preſence of them. And we cannot be wholly freed from the preſence of the evil of the world, before we be taken out of the World. And therefore as the Lord hath advanced our Savior far above Principalities and Powers, beyond the gun-ſhot of Satans temptations, and the evils of this vale of Tears: So the Lord Jeſus provides that we may triumph with him, as we have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. Therefore in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, while we live in the Field of the World, and the Church is here Militant, there wil be Tares, which wil annoy and trouble. But when the Lord ſhal ſend his Angels to gather out of his Kingdom al things that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and them which do iniquity: Then ſhal his Saints be tranſlated into the Kingdom of the Father. That which is the end of Chriſts Redemption, the perfection of his Body, the compleat happineſs of his People: that he muſt affectionately deſire. For the end ever carries, and commands the affection of the Agent, who works by Counſel and Reaſon.</p>

The former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine affords Spiritual refreſhing againſt al theſe: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fierceſt of al oppoſition, which al the Enemies of our Salvation can make againſt our progreſs, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in a Chriſtian Courſe. The Prayer of our Savior, is above the Power of Hel, and Devils, though they rage; above their malice and policy, though they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; above the corruption of mine own heart, which would betray, and deliver me as a prey, into the hands of Devils, and their Inſtruments. This Prayer of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, ſhal carry the Cauſe againſt them all, and thee to Heaven in deſpight of al. This Requeſt wil not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; this Wil of Chriſt, nothing can reſiſt.

                  <p>This was the beſt ſupport that ſhored up <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was at the hardeſt ſhock, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31, 32. Simon,

                  <p>Thou happily wilt ſay, Satan is ſubtil indeed, and the ſnares of the World ſecret; but I find moſt harm from mine own heart, a Wil that cannot ſubmit, and wil not come, though I might be ſaved. Look higher and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for help, to the Prayer of our Savior now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and there thou mayeſt certainly find. Chriſt ſaies, <hi>Father, I will that they be with me.</hi> The Devil, and men, and thine own heart, wil the contrary: whether wil the Father grant, and which of al theſe is like to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail?

                  <p>If Chriſt affectonately deſire our preſence, let us long to be with him, to be out of the Peſt-Houſe of the world, where we have been infected: out of this priſon of our corrupt Nature, where we have been deeply annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Body of death, and the ſtench of this carcaſe of abominations we bear about with us. Long we for the conſummation of the marriage, long for this day, that our Savior ſo much deſires. Our Savior longs for our company, worthleſs, Wretched that we be, though he have not need of us, and was ever happy without us, lies in the Boſom of his Father, and hath been his delight from Eternity, who hath millions of Angels to attend and ſerve him.</p>
                  <p>Yea ſo far longed for our company, that he came down from Heaven, and took our Nature, that he might die for our ſins in the daies of his humiliation, that thoſe may not hinder our beleeving and coming to him; and he would come again from Heaven, that he may take us to himſelf, that death may not ſtop our paſſage. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have more reaſon to long for him, of whom we have ſo much need, &amp; in whom we ſhal find ſo much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to ſleep out our daies in the boſom of his love through al eternity. If our Feofment and inheritance
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:66082:145"/>lay here, he would be with us here, but it is not, but reſerved for us in Heaven, where he is, and therefore he wil have us with himſelf. So they Iſa. 26.8. <hi>The deſire of our Souls is towards thy Name, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee.</hi> This is the laſt of al deſires, where they are compleat and ended. The Soul deſires union to the Body in the Grave: but Body and Soul deſire union with Chriſt, <hi>To follow the Lamb, where ever he goes.</hi> Why ſtand we gazing one upon another? go we to Heaven. When our Savior ſaies, <hi>I will, they be with me,</hi> Anſwer, <hi>and I wil be with thee, Lord.</hi> Say ſo ye Fathers and Mothers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ye are almoſt within ſight of ſhore: there is one ſtep to Death, that is the Wagon, and then to Chriſt.

And if any be yet in a demur, let me ask them, as <hi>Laban</hi> asked <hi>Rebecca. Gen.</hi> 24.57, 58. When <hi>Eleazar, Abrahams</hi> ſervant came to fetch her, <hi>Wilt thou go? and ſhe ſaid, I wil go.</hi> So let me propound the wil of Chriſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second Hindrance.</hi> When through careleſſneſs and guilt they looſe their evidence, and aſſurance of their intereſt in Chriſt, and acceptance with him. And therefore fear and ſo fly him as a Judg, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to be with him as a Savior.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Third Hindrance.</hi> When we pleaſe our ſelves with the certainty of what we have, and ſettle upon our own ſufficiency, and think we can make a ſhift: and therefore lay aſide the care of a Chriſt, becauſs that dale is mown, that danger is over, and fal hand-pat to other things.

                     <hi>The Firſt Help.</hi> Make ſure of our intereſt in Chriſt. And maintain it. <hi>I go to your God, and my God, your Father and my Father. Joh.</hi> 20.17. No man will leave the pooreſt cottage, the meaneſt proviſion, where he is, for the uncertain Hopes of a palace, when he knows not whether ever he ſhal injoy it. Ye know the place and the way.

                     <hi>The Second Help.</hi> See the dayly uſe and need of a Savior, and that wil maintain a dayly deſire; as men of an uſeful, helpful companion. Him we muſt needs have, ſales one, I pray you cal him: him we cannot want, I pray you intreat him. We can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, by any means prevail with him. So they ſay.</p>
                  <p>Truly without Chriſt we can do nothing. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. He ſaith it, we find it. Each man deſires to maintain his life. Such is Chriſt to us. Col. 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life &amp;c.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw more of himſelf and his life in Chriſt, than in himſelf. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. And therefore deſired to be abſent from the Body, that he might be preſent with Chriſt. And that he was a Stranger, while he was in the Body:</p>

                  <p>We have done with the ſecond particular.</p>
                  <p>The Third and laſt comes now to be conſidered and that is, The ſcope of our Savior in this his petition, and the maine good and benefit for which our Savior makes this requeſt for them. Namely,</p>

               <p>I ſay they happineſs of our being in Heaven lies in this: for this is the end at which our Savior aimes in this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This is the end of that Priviledg and bleſſing for which he Prayes. For it is not the place of Heaven, though the luſtre and beauty of it, is beyond compare, and indeed unconceivable; nor yet our being in Heaven, barely and nakedly conſidered could ſatisfie either our deſires or wants, and anſwer the Expectation of the Soul. If Chriſt were not there, or we might no injoy his preſence, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Els Gods frowns and diſpleaſure in Heaven would make it a Hell to the Soul, and that indeed inſufferable. Hence the Prophet makes this the higheſt pitch of al the Hopes and deſires he had, and the having of that was enough, and did ſatisfie fully. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. Having ſpoken of the Pomp and proſperity of the ungodly, they had what they would, and did what they would in this world, he repoſeth his ſpirit upon this; <hi>As for me I wil behold thy Face in righteouſneſs and when</hi> I <hi>awake</hi> I <hi>ſhal be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi> When he awakes at the day of reſurrection, The ſight of Gods glory gives ful ſatisfaction. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> Its not Heaven but God in Chriſt in Heaven, that makes it deſirable. All deſires of al the hearts of the Saints empty themſelves and end here. Their deſires are to thy Name. And the remembrance of thee. The Soul in Heaven deſires the union of the Body, and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and accompliſhment of the number of their fellow brethren.

                  <item>1. An attentive eye, and a ſetled holding of our Mind and thoughts about the things that are preſented to our underſtanding, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4. Now conſider how great this man was. When the holy Apoſtle would draw the Hebrews to the ſerious attendance of the excellency of the Type, and ſo of our Savior, who was typified by <hi>Melchizedek;</hi> he bid them to conſider; hold their thoughts bent to the object of ſo worthy attention.</item>
                  <item>2. It implies a through viewing of the whol compaſs of any thing thus preſented to conſideration, and ſo the word is very often uſed among Heathen Authors, to paſs as a Traveller from one place to another, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

Not only a mans apprehenſion comes to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as in the two former; but the quality and nature of the thing, comes ſo to be taken into our obſervation and conſideration; That the heart comes to be experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally affected therewith, <hi>John</hi> 12.19.

Here the Light of the Sun ſhining in a crevis, and day-hole, leaves yet the place dark, but then the Lord Chriſt ſhal ariſe as the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and fil (as that the whol Heaven; ſo this) the whol heart. So Chriſt ſhines in the Counſels, Comrorts &amp;c. of the Miniſtry of the Word, and makes us <hi>ſee the Day-ſtar ariſing,</hi> but ſtil there be ſhadows: But then he wil ariſe in our hearts, and al theſe ſhadows ſhal fly away. <hi>I ſhall know as I am known.</hi>

                     <item>3. Moſt effectually and powerfully, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.2. It's the Inference the Apoſtle makes, and the reaſon he brings to force this Conſequence, and that infallibly. <hi>We ſhal be like him;</hi> How comes that? <hi>We ſhall ſee him as be is.</hi> For as the Spirit of Chriſt, by his Special preſence in the Soul, and work upon it, is the only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of al Grace and Holineſs, which we do here, or ſhal hereafter poſſeſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.

And hence our Savior, when he would difference his Servants from the wicked in the World to whom he never intends any ſaving good, nor do they partake thereof, he gives this as a ground, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>The Father will ſend his Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him.</hi> No Spirit, no Grace. But the World hath no Spirit, becauſe they cannot receive him; and that becauſe they do not ſee not know: But they ſee, therefore receive, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the Spirit, and therefore have Grace: and therefore the Apoſtle concludes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>Whoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, nor known him.</hi> True, it is poſſible the wicked may have a glimmering of the Truth, and hear tel of a Chriſt, by the common bruit of the World, as they read ſuch things writ: But this is a falſe Light, the Star-light of ſome common apprehenſions of Reaſon, Arguments which are preſented to us in Speech and Diſcourſe. But the Apoſtle ads, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If ye have heard and learned Chriſt, and been taught by him as the Truth is in Jeſus.</hi> Ye have heard of the Truth and Chriſt, as then are in words which report him, as Arguments and Reaſons which diſcourſe and diſpute about him; but the Truth as it is in Jeſus, as it iſſues from a Jeſus, from a Savior, and from that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, enlightening, over-powring work; when it's ſet on by the hand of a Jeſus, not by Man, Education, or Diſputation, then it wil make men to put off the old man, and be renewed in the ſpirit of their minds. This the eyeing of Jeſus in a right manner in this Life, wil do. But when we come to ſee Chriſt as he is in his Glory, all thoſe impediments which either ſtopped, or leſſened the work of the Spirit from conveying that fulneſs of Grace, which otherwiſe it would, and by which we might have been perfectly like him, are then taken away.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now the impediments which ſtop the current and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:66082:151"/>of the Spirit are, either in regard of the means, whereby he is diſpenſed, or in regard of our hearts, wherein he is received.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the means; they are either narrow, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits from the Fountain, or Creeks from the Sea, of ſmal power, and convey little help in ſpiritual ſupply, as Word and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Or elſe the Inſtruments are weak and cracked, and ſo ſtop the ſtream, and corrupt, and ſinful; and therefore though not utterly hinder the work of the Spirit, yet wrong and defile it much.</p>
               <p>But then the Lord Chriſt wil do his work by himſelf, when his Spirit ſhal have ful ſcope; the narrowneſs of means ſhal not ſtreighten him, the weakneſs of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hinder him, to expreſs the ful power of his Grace in ful perfection, but <hi>God ſhall now be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whatever Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer, could, or did convey; whatever the Power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the Miniſtry of the Word, the Counſel of Saints, endeavored to work in you; he wil be inſtead of al, and do more than al. Ye prayed for a Chriſt, did ye not? Ye heard for a Chriſt, received for a Chriſt, conferred, humbled, to come more neer a Chriſt, to enjoy more of him, do more for him: Alas, that Chriſt ye deſired to hear ſome Tidings of, <hi>ye ſhal ſee him,</hi> not in weakneſs of Ordinances, Miniſtry of his Servants, &amp;c. <hi>ye ſhal ſee him as he is,</hi> in the higheſt ſtrain of Eminency of al Grace, acting to its utmoſt for your good, that which they all could not do.</p>
               <p>They did convey but imperfect power againſt ſin, peace and comfort to your Conſcience: but now ye ſhal find al power perfectly, and conſtantly, gloriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from this Glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There ſhal be no impediment to hinder or ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Spirit from conveying; no impediment on our part, no hindrance in our Souls, becauſe they ſhal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

The whol imployment of the whol man being nothing elſe, but to attend upon Chriſt, and to ſubmit to him, to be carried by the preſence, power, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Spirit alone. Look as it is with In-mates under a Roof; the one is conſtrained to confine himſelf, to heap up, and tumble his Houſhold-ſtuff together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not room to ſet it forth: but when al are outed, and he hath ful ſcope in his Houſe and Family, he may order al in their ful beauty.

Hence the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>We ſhall ever be with him.</hi> We are now peſtered with unwelcome gueſts, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſend going, Pride and Peeviſhneſs, Weariſhneſs, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs, &amp;c. and they are with us in our Prayers, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Hearing, Conferences: Whence it is we crowd Chriſt into a narrow corner, not an Ear to hear, a Mind to attend, our Prayers few and faint, &amp;c. We are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and moleſted with Friends, miſeries, wants, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, families, occaſions, they are calling and crowding. But then the Coaſt wil be cleer, we ſhal only be with Chriſt. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaking concerning faſting and Prayer, enjoyns the Man and Wife to part mutual Company and Society, and forſake their Contentments in their mutual fellowſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. that they might give themſelves to Prayer. While we live here, we give away ſome Love, beſtow ſome delight, ſpend ſome
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:66082:152"/>thoughts and affections, take ſome content in theſe; therefore he would have them al laid aſide, that <hi>we might give our ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> Now this ſhal be done at that day: nay not only, and alone bound for Chriſt: But now it's the whol imployment of the Soul to attend upon him; the Soul hath none other to ſee, nothing elſe to do. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. <hi>They follow the Lamb where ever be goes;</hi> ſee no Wife, nor Child, nor Friend, nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Pleaſure, but Chriſt only; <hi>Old things are paſſed:</hi> Have none to love, to deſire, to delight in, to be ſatisfied with, but Chriſt alone. Now we ſend our thoughts and affections upon other Errands. If a man knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, loved nothing, needed nothing, but one thing, how would that carry him, command him, prevail with him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How this brings in this Happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Upon a double Ground: and here we have a double Reaſon of the Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe men come to receive more of God, and that in the moſt intimate and inward manner: and this is one end of the great Works of God in our Creation and Redemption, of our being men and Chriſtians, that he might leave the impreſſions and manifeſtations of himſelf, and his Divine perfections upon us, whom he would have to be Monuments of thoſe everlaſting Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and glorious Attributes through al Eternity. For God cannot but work for his own Glory; and becauſe there can be no addition made to himſelf, who is infinite in al his Excellencies, therefore there muſt be only a manifeſtation of theſe, and this is the aim of al Gods Counſels. He wil ſhew forth, and make Editions of his glorious Grace and Mercy, which may be ſeen, and read, and acknowledged; therefore a world, therefore a man; and he a Veſſel of glorious Grace: When they partake moſt of his glorious Mercy, and are tunn'd top
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:66082:152"/>ful of glory, and there is nothing els; Then the Lord attains the end of the work of his Grace. For its not Heaven, the place, nor the freedom from evil, or the preſence and confluence of al pleaſure, or our being there that makes us happy: But the injoyment of God in al his perfections; and ſhould he withdraw himſelf, Heaven were a Hel, and we as miſerable as Devils. We then attain our ſupream happineſs, when we attain our end, and our good is, to have more of God. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> That Chriſt may be glorified in life and death.</p>
               <p>Its part of the ſcope of Gods proceeding at the day of judgment. 2. Theſſ. 1.10. <hi>He wil be glorious in his Saints, but admired in al thoſe that beleeve.</hi> He wil be glorious in the Eyes of al ſtanders by, Angels and Devils, for the Grace that then ſhal be expreſſed in the Saints: But that by faith they have received Chriſt, and come to be one with God through him, and receive al by him, this dazels the Eyes of Angels, and amazeth the hearts of Devils. Yea its a work beyond admiration implies ſome thing unexpected, ſuch as we cannot tel the reaſon of, that is matter of admiration, is not in comprehenſion.</p>
               <p>The Devils have ſeen men holy and innocent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable, as <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. But when the Devils ſhal ſee ſuch as were haters of Chriſt and God, to receive Chriſt, and to be made one with God, through him: to have God to be al in al, when they were without God in the world, this wil make Angels to be ſwallowed up in admiration.</p>
               <p>This is an eſpecial part of that reward that God hath promiſed unto his: not to have freedom from annoyance, nay the preſence of evil, but to have himſelf: God communicating himſelf in al the fulneſs of perfections fully to the Soul, as it is capable of. God is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective happineſs to the Soul in himſelf, and ſo its equal to al: but God communicating himſelf in his fulneſs, as
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:66082:153"/>far as a ſinner is capable, is part of that ſpecial reward we have in Heaven. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. Lament: 3.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> More of our Souls are for God.

God without means: God inſtead of al means: God only and no means. Now ſome love, and joy, and deſire &amp;c. Is ſpent upon the choice ordinances:</p>
               <p>But then none of al theſe, are in the Eye and deſire; but al the faculties of the Soul are fully taken up with God.

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:66082:153"/>through him, upon God. You by receiving of Grace become to have his image: by the exerciſe of Grace, you become to be like him, and ſuck out the ſweet of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good that is in him. For herein lies the beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Viſion of God. If truly glorious and efficatious, brings in the fruition of him and his goodneſs,</hi> which is our laſt end, and chiefeſt good, which is not to be in Heaven, but to pleaſe God, and chooſe his wil, wil his wil. We meet with God, and ſuck out a ſatisfying goodneſs in him in ſo doing, this is one end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But both theſe are to be attended and neither ſeper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the other.</hi> The wel-working and exerciſe of our Grace is the end: <hi>but that Barely</hi> I doubt wil not do it. <hi>For no creature</hi> can give content to the Soul, but our wel-working is a creature. Therefore with that I added alſo, <hi>A relliſh of ſatisfying goodneſs,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of that goodneſs, That is, God in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by acting upon him, and we communicating from him, al the perfection we are capable of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We may be ſaid to be like God, and to have his Image, becauſe we have Grace. But we are moſt like him, and communicate moſt of al good from him, when we cloſe with him in the act of his Grace.</hi> Satisfie me with thy mercy. I ſhal behold thy Face, and be ſatisfied. The iſſue is, If by our beholding of the glory of Chriſt ſo immediately, effectually, we receive more of God, are more for God in meeting with him, and ſucking out ſatisfying good from him,</p>
               <p>Then the happineſs of out being in Heaven is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of our Lord Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Be it known unto you ye damned creatures, this is the Son of God, the glory of whoſe conquering Grace hath broke my flinty heart, or els I had burned in Hel with you: that wretched Creature that was proud, and is now humbled, as ye ſee: he that was eſtranged from God and Heaven, and is now called, converted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, Know that Chriſt hath ſhed down that Grace ye now ſee. He hath done there great things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hold thoſe glorious excellencies unto the Eye of the Soul, that they may never depart away from it, nor the Soul withdraw it ſelf from them, until they leave an impreſſion upon it.</hi> Therefore if any thing beſides come in the way between the Soul and Chriſt, or would cal off the Soul, attend it not.

Properly, ſpeaking according to our apprehenſion, and the practice of the vertue in our ordinary converſe betwixt man and man; it's that vertue, whereby we give every one their due: and that is either by way of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, called diſtributive Juſtice, in giving Honor to whom Honor belongs; or of Commutation, in our Contracts and Bargainings, when we make payment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the worth and price of things, called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative Juſtice; or elſe Corrective Juſtice, when in Civil Judicature of Cauſes and Perſons, we reſpect no mans Perſon, but the equity and right of the Cauſe; and give to every Cauſe his ful due.</p>
            <p>Some Needle-headed men, who are ſharp, and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-ſighted
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:66082:157"/>in the ſearch of Secrets, they have conceived, and concluded; That this Commutative Juſtice cannot be attributed to God. For they imagine it would caſt ſome kind of diſparagement and imperfection upon the Majeſty of the Almighty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God ſhould be bound, and become a Debtor to the Creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where Commutative Juſtice is, there one may receive ſomthing from another, as wel as give ſomthing to another.</p>
            <p>With this I wil not now meddle, becauſe it is not the ſpecial intent of the place. However, I confeſs the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Conceit, wil not eaſily ſatisfie my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For I ſee no more diſparagement put upon God to be bound by the Goodneſs of his Nature, than to be bound by his free Prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. He is Debtor to his own wil in the one, as to his Nature in the other. Nor do I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee what prejudice is done to the Soveraignty of Gods Wil, and abſolute Dominion, to ſay, The goodneſs of his Will, cannot go croſs to his Juſtice, then it cannot go croſs to his infinite Wiſdom, and Prudence, which all grant. Beſides, Juſtice is exerciſed according to the Nature of that Commerce and Intercourſe which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Parties with whom it is exerciſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the Juſtice of God, may have wrong by the breach of a Rule: ſo it may receive content and ſatisfaction equally by the full reſtoring of a Rule.</hi> Though no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal hurt can be done to the Eſſence of God; for in that there is no intercourſe of Juſtice, betwixt the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Creator. Yet there may be wrong done to the Covenant of God, in which regard Juſtice only is to be attended, as it is exerciſed betwixt God and the Creature. If it were a diſparagement to God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive equal to wrong done; how could the merits of Chriſt, give equal ſatisfaction for our ſins, and that to the exact Juſtice of God? wherein the Glory of Gods Juſtice, is not prejudiced, but advanced. It Juſtice wil
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:66082:157"/>require the manifeſtation of his Goodneſs, by the work of the Creature. It's but equal, in caſe it be wronged in her Commands, to glorifie his Severity in puniſhing. By ſome proportion, in caſe it be pleaſed, and content, it may reward the work by bleſſing: Neither doth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice deprive her ſelf of the Dominion of that which ſhe doth beſtow: but in what ſhe beſtows, and they receive, in al they are bound to ſerve, and yield obedience unto Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Beſides, by Juſtice thus to convey a change, deprives God no more of the Dominion of the thing, than to paſs away a right by promiſe.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, He becomes a Debtor to his own Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo alſo he becomes Debtor to the Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Nature. For it was from Gods Juſtice that he was made fit to execute, and keep the Covenant; and it was from the goodneſs of his Nature, he made him ſo: and therefore is only bound to the goodneſs of his own Nature, in whatever Covenant he enters with him.</p>
            <p>We cannot be profitable to God; as a man is profitable to his Neighbor, to give him ſomthing he wanted: but we may be profitable in furthering <hi>Gods ends, by that which we have received from God.</hi> But I wil not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with this.</p>
            <p n="2">2, To be righteous therefore, in the Second place, is to be juſt mour Promiſes, when we do what we ſpeak. As in our ordinary Language; he is a man that is juſt in his word, he is a juſt man of his promiſe. And thus the Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.1. and 115.1. and 143.11. therefore the Promiſe is called the Word of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.23. In this loſt Condition, in which forlorn man is, and in the Covenant of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in which lies al our Comfort, we have nothing to plead in regard of our ſelves, but the faithful Word of Gods Promiſe: but in regard of Chriſt, I find the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture joyns them together, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful, and juſt to forgive,</hi> where we
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:66082:158"/>have both joyned. Faithful in regard of his free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to us in Chriſt: juſt in regard of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, which by Chriſt hath been laid down, and paid for our ſin, and he hath merited by way of juſt payment, ful ſatisfaction, and forgiveneſs of our ſin. Theſe two cannot be the ſame: For the one cannot be put by way of expoſition of the other, becauſe then, the more dark ſhould be uſed to explicate the more cleer; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to expound the proper; if Juſtice ſhould expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate what Faithfulneſs were. So that in a true ſenſe, both are truly attributed to God: but the Second is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially intended in this place. Hence we have two Points.</p>

               <p>When our Savior would obtain the higheſt mercy, that the Love of God might dwel in them, he eyes him as a Father; in which Relation there is the deareſt and greateſt Love of al. He eyes him in his Faithfulneſs, and there is the freeſt and ſureſt, and never failing Love.</p>
               <p>God was a Father to <hi>Adam</hi> in Creation, in giving
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:66082:158"/>him his Being, as one of his Generation, which was brought out of his Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs: but this Love, though it was dear, and the greateſt that God extended to any Creature in the World: yet <hi>Adam</hi> fel from that Eſtate, and became a Child of Wrath.</p>
               <p>But the Faithful look not to the Love of a Father meerly, but to the Love of his Faithfulneſs, and that wil not fail, not ſhal they ever fal from it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſhal obſerve in the Deſcription of our Savior, which is laid forth at large in the firſt of the Revelation, in the Sum and ful diſcovery of the excellency of Chriſt, that the Lord appears, and preſents him to each Church in the expreſſion of Excellency, which anſwered the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular neceſſity of the Churches Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Smyrna</hi> was under great preſſures, and the Devil caſt ſome of them into Priſon, ſo that they were in a dying Condition: therefore Chriſt appears to them as firſt and laſt, who was dead, and is alive, Chap. 2.8. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could ever preſerve them, and would recover them from death.</p>
               <p>To the Church to <hi>Thyatira,</hi> becauſe they grew ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, and tolerated the Woman <hi>Jezebel</hi> to ſet her Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſale, and vent her Follies, and Filth, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs under the name of a Propheteſs: therefore Chriſt appears to that Church, as one that hath Eyes like a flame of Fire, who wil ſearch into al Secrets, verſe 18. and Feet of Braſs that wil trample al to duſt, againſt whom his indignation proceeds.</p>
               <p>Vaunting <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who miſtook her own Eſtate, and thought ſhe was rich, and yet was poor, verſe 17. he preſents himſelf to her, as a faithful and true Witneſs, verſe 14. They bear falſe Witneſs of their Condition, but he would give in that which was true.</p>

For in that ſpecial conſideration this knowledg is here to be attended, and ſo reſtrained. He ſaith not, nor yet meaneth that they did not know God, or know the Father as God, or his Deity: for it is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſſion and affirmation of the Apoſtle, touching the Gentiles in the general, look at them in the lump, as they lie in the loynes of loſt <hi>Adam.</hi> Rom. 1.18. <hi>They know God, but did not glorifie God, as God: nay God is not only manifeſt to them, but in them.</hi> Verſe, 19.</p>

                  <p>There be ſome of Gods ordinary Courteſies which he extends in common to al Creatures; his Rain fals, his Sun ſhines upon good and bad. He gives Life, and Breath, and Being to al things, <hi>Acts,</hi> 17. Al things are at his finding, and the eyes of al things look to him, and he fils every living thing with his Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>There be alſo peculiar, and choyce Favors, which he hath reſerved for his Secret Ones, in the ſecret Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of his Providences, <hi>which none know but his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites.</hi> The <hi>deep things of God,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. The Spirit only ſearcheth theſe deep things. His everlaſting Mercy, and Fatherly Faithfulneſs in Chriſt. Theſe are deep things; and as no man knows what is in man, but the Spirit of man: ſo no man knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>And it's the Anſwer to that Queſtion, 1 Cor. 2. and laſt, <hi>Who hath known the mind of the Lord?</hi> q. d. None can pry into the Ark of his Privy Counſel, which
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66082:165"/>hath been from everlaſting: and therefore he ads, <hi>We have the mind of Chriſt.</hi> He that hath Chriſts mind, may know Gods mind, for he is Privy to it. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes; even ſo, O Father, becauſe it ſeemed good in thy ſight: no man knows who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> It muſt be from the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, that any come to the right knowledg of the Father, <hi>John,</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; but the only begotten Son, who came out of the Boſom of the Father, he hath revealed him,</hi> that is, thoſe Boſom Affections of his Fatherly Love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Apprehenſions, and Conceivings of God, hold proportion with his Diſpenſations of himſelf to us. There muſt be ever ſome print of ſome operation and impreſſion of his Excellencies, or Relation left upon us, before any thing can be diſcerned: <hi>For he dwells in the Light that no Creature can attain unto:</hi> and to pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Secrets, which he hath reſerved in his own Boſom, as indeed <hi>we ſhould not (Secret things belong to the Lord, but things revealed, to us)</hi> ſo in truth, we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> reach them, they are far beyond the ſcantling of our ſhallow Conceits.</p>
                  <p>Now the expreſſions which God leaves of his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love and Faithfulneſs, are ſound no where, but in the hearts of his, whom he cals unto himſelf: Them he takes into the Boſom of his Love: To them he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates theſe Boſom Secrets, the Foot-ſteps whereof are to be found no where upon Earth, but in the Souls of the Faithful: Therefore they only can ſee the Print of them, they only come to know them.</p>
                  <p>The great Characters of Gods Power, Wiſdom, and Bounty, are left inſtamped, and engraven upon each Creature; and therefore they may be ſeen of al, and read of al, and ſo known.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are the unknown yernings of the Bowels of a Father, which can be owned by none, but ſuch who are his own, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. He gives a new Name, which no man knows, but he that hath it, unknown Benevolence, and unknown Complacency of a Fathers Bowels.</p>

Therefore it is not ſafe to lean to the Counſel, or be led by the Opinion of Carnal men, touching the doubts we have, or difficulties we find, concerning the Love of God unto our ſouls, and his Faithfulneſs in the performance of his gracious Promiſes. Alas, they know nothing of thoſe things, how ſhal they be able to make us know them? They underſtood nothing themſelves, and how ſhal they reach others? Is any ſo weak, and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he would go to a blind man, to make him judg of Colors? or a deaf man of Sounds? or he that never knew the way, to be a Guide, to lead him the way? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he were reſolved to miſs his way, and end alſo. True indeed, they may ſomtimes ſpeak things by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay; but to ſpeak things from grounded Knowledg and Experience, they cannot, becauſe they have none.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

The World, it is likely, may lay you in her Boſom, for the World wil love her own: but ye be far enough from the Love of the Father, as ye be far from the knowledg of him. Hence a Sea of Miſery breaks in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, able to over-whelm thy Soul irrecoverably. If it can be once ſaid, <hi>Thou knoweſt not the Father,</hi> there is enough ſaid to ſink thy heart in everlaſting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.

                  <p>But it's the depth of thy Miſery, thou canſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:66082:167"/>heart. The holy Spirit, would take of Chriſts, and ſo of the Fathers, and give to thee: But thou art a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wicked wretch, and thou canſt not receive the Spirit, nor Chriſt, nor Mercy, nor Love, if thou had'ſt them laid before thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as thou canſt receive no good from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ſo thou canſt perform no good Duty to him, that may find acceptance with him, or a bleſſing from him.</hi> Thou knoweſt not the Father, therefore thou canſt not love him, nor fear, nor honor, nor obey him.

Nay, mark what I ſay, Thou did'ſt never pray to this Father of Chriſt, and of al compaſſion in him. If I wil pray with my Tongue, I wil pray with my Underſtanding alſo, ſaies the Apoſtle. Upon that Father thou did'ſt never cal, that thou did'ſt never know to this day. It was a Fancy of thine own deviſing, it was not the Father of Chriſt, and thine in him thou called'ſt upon: For thou could'ſt not ſeek to him, that thou could'ſt never know to this day. Happily thou haſt learned the Lecture without Book, and canſt ſpeak the words by rote: but thou wilt not ſay, ſpeaking words argues the reality of knowledg. Parrots can prattle words, which out of Cuſtom they have heard, but underſtand not the things.

This is that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> peremptorily affirms, and that with as much indignation and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as can be, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. <hi>We are of God, but the whol world lies in wickedneſs.</hi> It is not only <hi>wicked,</hi> or ſome of it may be ſo conceived, but the <hi>whol</hi> of it is <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and it <hi>lies</hi> in it. The whol Frame, Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, yea, the very Conſtitution of the Circuit of the World, is ſetled upon ſuch Lees: and therefore the ſame Apoſtle undeniably infers it, Chap. 2.15. <hi>Love not the World, &amp;c, for if any man love the world;</hi> theſe are at that deadly feud, that they cannot ſtand together, they deſtroy each other. <hi>If any man,</hi> be he what he wil, you ever find it true in al perſons, at al times; <hi>the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="reasons">
                  <head>REASONS, <hi>are three.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider the higheſt Fountain, and firſt author from whence their diſpoſitions and operations do ariſe, both in our Savior, in the Saints, in the World, and in the Wicked. There ye ſhal perceive the oppoſition to be in the higheſt ſtrain, that can come within the reach of reaſon, or indeed can be in the reality of truth.</p>
                  <p>Hither our Savior looks, when he would diſcover the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:66082:169"/>rock, out of which they were hewn, and the firſt Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that profaneneſs and Wickedneſs which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowes in the hearts and lives of the ungodly. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.38. When he would lead the wicked Jews to the Fountain, whence their cruelty and murderous carriage did proceed, he points at it with the Finger. I <hi>ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have ſeen with your Father.</hi> They An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>Abraham is our Father.</hi> Jeſus ſaith unto them: <hi>If ye were</hi> Abrahams <hi>Children ye would do</hi> Abrahams <hi>works; but ye ſeek to kill me,</hi> and this did not <hi>Abraham. But ye do the deeds of their Father.</hi> They could not conceive what he meant: And therefore ſtil reply; <hi>We are not born of Fornication, we have one Father, even God:</hi> Our Savior again returnes an undeniable evidence. <hi>If ye were of God, ye would love me for</hi> I <hi>came from God, nor came I of my ſelf, but God ſent me.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe al theſe were Riddles: he ſpeaks out, and ſhews them the Root of their wretchedneſs. Verſe, 44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil: and the luſts of your Father ye wil do; He was a murderer, and abode not in the truth:</hi> and what he ſaies of one, he ſaies of al ſins in the like caſe. <hi>When he ſpeaks a lie, he ſpeaks of his own, for he is the Father of lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As God is the firſt cauſe of truth and goodneſs, and from his fulneſs al the beams and ſtreams of truth are derived to any who ſhare therein: So Satan is the firſt cauſe of falſhood and wickedneſs, and therefore called. <hi>The Wicked one;</hi> And from him al wickedneſs is deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And hence ungodly men are called <hi>The Seed of the Serpent. Gen.</hi> 3.15. They are ſaid to be <hi>of that Wicked one.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.11. Cain <hi>was of that Wicked one;</hi> Put in way of oppoſition, <hi>To be born of God.</hi> This I take to be the meaning of thoſe Phraſes and texts, which hence receive their explication, as belonging I conceive, properly to this place. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.23. When our Savior would ſhew the diſtance and great diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:66082:169"/>between himſelf and the wretched and ungodly Jews, he ſpeaks, <hi>Ye are from beneath,</hi> I am <hi>from above. Ye are of this world,</hi> I am <hi>not of this world.</hi> Joh. 17.14. I <hi>have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of this world, even as</hi> I <hi>am not of this world.</hi> Here we have the Wel-head of hatred, becauſe they are not of the world. And we ſee that this agrees to Chriſt, as to them, and to them, by means of Chriſt; that as he ſpeaks els where. Joh. 8.28. <hi>He can do nothing, but what he ſees his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do.</hi> Joh. 14.10. <hi>The words that</hi> I <hi>ſpeak, I ſpeak not of my ſelf, but the Father that dwelleth in me,</hi> As the firſt perſon dwels in the ſecond, he is thus from the Father, and works from the Father. So his Saints and faithful are of and from the Father, by him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the wicked, <hi>They are of the world.</hi> That is, their diſpoſitions which are corrupt, they iſſue firſtly from Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an, who caſt's in his Seed of rebellion into their hearts, according to which they are framed. And upon this ground, he is called <hi>the God of the world.</hi> As he is firſtly evil and cannot but be evil, and al evil is from him, that is in the world. For by his wickedneſs, al the world and wicked comes to be tainted, and by the leaven of his wickedneſs, defiled. Their minds, ſo far as erronious, are made up of his deluſions. Their hearts, as they are ſtuborne and ungodly, are made up of his rebellions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the next immediate cauſe, by which they are acted, this alſo wil evidence the ſtrength and diſtance of their oppoſition, and that in the greateſt extremity. And this you ſhal find moſt pregnantly. 1 Cor. 2.12. <hi>Now we have received, not the ſpirit of the world but the Spirit, which is of God, that we might know the things, that are graciouſly given us of God.</hi> So that there is a ſpirit of the world, which blinds mens minds; and minds which the light of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, cannot ſhine upon them, nor the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:66082:170"/>power of any ſavory truth or good come neer them, or work upon them; but they ſtop the paſſage againſt al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do moſt deſperately and reſolutely oppoſe al. And that is perverted mutability ſet on, or ſet a going by the provoking and curſing power of the Law, the malignity of Satan, having leave, and ſomtime command from God, to wind up the wickedneſs of mens ſpirits to the higheſt ſtrain of the activity of evil.</p>
                  <p>When God ſaid, <hi>who wil go and deceive Ahab,</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan anſwers, <hi>I wil.</hi> The Lord asks, how? <hi>I wil,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>Be a lying Spirit in the mouth of the falſ Prophets. q. d.</hi> It was in his power, if God would give leave, to act their minds and Tongues, as one man, to ſpeak and perſwade unto deceiptful waies, which would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly bring to ruin. And this is the meaning of thoſe two Phraſes. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. Men are ſaid to <hi>walk according to the courſe of the world:</hi> one Spirit and guiſe in them al. If it be asked, what that is, he adds, <hi>According to the Prince of the Air, the Spirit, that now worketh &amp;c.</hi> When the Prince of the Air, by his impulſions and ſuggeſtions draws out the diſtempers of the ungodly to the utmoſt activity. And this is noted in the next words, <hi>They fulfilled the wils of the Fleſh and of the mind,</hi> what a corrupt heart and Vain Head would carry a man unto. He muſt needs go, whom the Devil drives. This is called the wil of the Gentiles, that is, what men, left to the corruption of their Natures, would wil.</p>
                  <p>Contrarily, The Holy Ghoſt takes ful poſſeſſion of our Savior, and from Chriſt, dwels in the hearts of his Saints, by which they are ſtrengthened, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. Strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man. So that there is,
<list>
                        <item>1. The inner man, which is Grace.</item>
                        <item>2. Strengthened in this.</item>
                        <item>3. By the might of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</item>
                     </list> So, <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.15. yea, not only <hi>ſtrengthen,</hi> and <hi>lead,</hi> but <hi>mightily,</hi> and actively <hi>works in his,</hi> when they are quickened to work the Works of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:66082:170"/>God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. laſt; I ſtrove, but it is according to the working of Chriſt, and that is mightily: therefore <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid, <hi>They could not reſiſt the Spirit by which he spake,</hi> Acts, 6. As the Prince of Darkneſs by his Impulſions, draws out the Activity of Corruption in the ſtrength of it; So the Prince of Light and Grace, the Lord Chriſt, is greater than he that is in the World, and carries the Faithful by an invincible Power.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Look at them in the main ends at which they aim, in al their Operations and Proceedings. Our Savior came not to do his own wil, or ſeek his own; but to do the wil, and ſeek the Glory of the Father. Therefore the Scope of his whol Work, it is, to <hi>break the Head of the Serpent,</hi> Gen. 3.15. <hi>To deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 John, 3.8. <hi>To deliver from the preſent evil world, Gal.</hi> 1.4. And al the Saints are of the ſame Heart, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Colors, and Command. When the Devil, and the World; the Prince of this World, and the Children of this World, they ſet themſelves in al their Contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, plottings, practices, to deſtroy the Glory of God, the Kingdom of God and Chriſt; and ſet up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs, and wickedneſs, in the minds and hearts of men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Michael,</hi> and his Angels: the Dragon, and his Angels</p>

                  <p>Let the ungodly, for their own ends, and to ſerve their
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:66082:171"/>own turns, profeſs never ſo fair, promiſe never ſo much, pretend never ſo much Love and Faithfulneſs, and ſeem alſo ſomwhat ſeriouſly to endeavor to ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the hearts of the Godly: Be they never ſo neer in acquaintance, and familiarity with them: Be they for the preſent, never ſo ſtudious, and laborious in al proceedings to promote their good. It's certain, their diſtempers are but reſtrained, and the malignity of their Nature curbed, and confined for the while: Let but occaſion ſuit, and temptation be offered, and they wil be as deadly Enemies, nay, moſt fierce in their malice, and out-rage, as they have been friendly in appearance in former times. None more inward with <hi>David,</hi> than <hi>Achitophel,</hi> while opportunity ſerved to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own Honor, by that acceptance he had with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. It was thou my familiar friend, we took ſweet Counſel together, and went up to the Houſe of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether alſo:</hi> complied in al occaſions, temporal, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, were endeared each to other, bore each other in their very Boſoms: But no ſooner is Conſpiracy ſtirred, and Rebellion raiſed by <hi>Abſhalom,</hi> that was likely to carry it; but <hi>Achitophel,</hi> he forſakes his Colors, forgets al former Engagements, becomes the deadlieſt Enemy of the moſt inward, and endeared Friend, as formerly he did pretend. <hi>Judas</hi> trained up under the Wing of Chriſt, but he had a worldly heart; and when the time ſerved, he betray'd his Maſter for it. Never therefore, look what men pretend, but look what they are: If he be of the World, and Friend to it, know aſſuredly, he wil be an Enemy to God. And therefore, it checks the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Conceits, and miſguided Apprehenſions of ſome of Gods own, that are Novices in Religion, who are apt to conclude, It's want of Prudence, and Chriſtian Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Humility, and ſweetneſs of Carriage, that they do not win every man, even the wicked, and ſuch as be worldly, and Carnal; that they might have their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, their Love, and Affections, as they liſt enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:66082:171"/>Oh! men are not prudent, they do not ſo wiſely carry themſelves in that courteous manner as they ſhould; they might win al, and have every mans good word. If a man wil not lay aſide his Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let him walk as prudently, and melt into kindneſs and Courteſie; the World wil be croſs to him, and he to it: and he muſt conclude, he ſhal find contention and oppoſition. Al his Policy wil not work his Peace. It's folly to expect, and it's madneſs to promiſe it, That Reconciliations, and Contradictions ſhould meet. Who walked in greater Prudence and Innocency, than our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior; beyond the exception of Envy it ſelf: and yet he was not beyond Oppoſition, and that moſt fierce, which he found in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt not judg the worſe of mens Perſons and Profeſſion, becauſe of that univerſal oppoſition they find abroad. It's the portion of Chriſt, and that which al thoſe that are like him, muſt expect. It was the Sect of the Saints, and ſuch as followed the Rule of the Lord, of whom they confeſſed, as a thing commonly known. <hi>This Sect is ſpoken againſt, every where,</hi> and yet no <hi>Sect</hi> ſincere but that, <hi>Acts,</hi> 28.21. Al men perſecuted, and ſpake evil of ſuch, of whom the Word, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior ſpeaks Bleſſedneſs: <hi>Bleſſed are ye, when all men perſecute you, and speak evil of you, for my Names ſake, Matth.</hi> 5.10. They may as juſtly, and reaſonably challenge Gods Name guilty, and blame-worthy, as thoſe who profeſs it, becauſe that is moſt of al oppoſed, and condemned, when men are reviled for that. Therefore it is a ſhallow, and miſ-guided Conceit of ſome who are ignorant, to make ſuch Inferences. Certainly, al is not right, there is ſome more than ordinary failings in his way, a ſhrewd ſuſpicion his courſe is faulty, elſe how comes it he ſhould be oppoſed, and ſpoken againſt by ſo many, ſo univerſally. The World is up in Arms againſt him. So it was againſt Patriarchs, Prophets, Diſciples, and Chriſt. Therefore the Lord hates the World, praies
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:66082:172"/>not for the World, condemns the World. It was no more, but what Chriſt found, and thoſe who are moſt like him ſhal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Saving Converſion wil break the deareſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and neereſt Relation in the world, amongſt thoſe that are of the world.</p>

Thus Chriſt is ſaid to come into the world, to ſet the Mother-in-Law, againſt the Daughter-in-Law, <hi>The Father againſt the Son, a mans Enemies ſhal be thoſe of his own Houſe.</hi> His ſaving Grace ſets them in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt oppoſition, and contrariety; and therefore muſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the greateſt contention amongſt them.

               <p>I ſay the knowledg of the Father, for that is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be carried along with us, in our conſideration, and to be kept in our Eye, that we may keep to the ſcope of the place and aime of our Savior in his Prayer and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>For he looks at him, as we have ſhewed, as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father, ſuch a one as doth diſpenſe his Fatherly affection in Faithfulneſs unto his. And therefore thoſe of the world, upon whom his Fatherly affection was never ſet: nor were they within the compaſs of the Covenant of his Grace, had no intereſt therein, to whom his Faithfulneſs and truth was never ingaged, and therefore they could challenge nothing, nor yet was he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound to accompliſh any thing for their ſpiritual and eternal good; And therefore if our Savior had prayed for them, that they ſhould have been in Heaven, and have ſeen his glory, he had prayed for that, which the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:66082:174"/>Father was not bound to grant in Faithfulneſs, nor were they fit to injoy. For they know not that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and affection of his which moved him to give Chriſt that glory: nor could they be affected with it, nor receive the good of it.</p>
               <p>But He, who knew the Father, he Prayes for this Favor: And he Prayes for them alſo, who have known both the Father and him, in their conjoint purpoſe: The one, that is, the Father appointing and ſending: The other, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Son, coming upon that commiſſion of love and life for the good of his, which they knew, and in which they rejoyce.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt, who was in the commiſſion to work this, and they for whom it was wrought, and knew it, have an intereſt in it, and take content to injoy it: That ſuch perſons ſhould Beg for ſuch Priviledges, From ſuch a Father, whoſe heart is towards them, and their minds and hearts towards him and his Fatherly affection: This muſt of neceſſity be of great power to prevail with ſo righteous a Father to hear and grant, therefore we muſt hold it to this point and reſpect. Chriſt knows him as a righteous Father. The Lord Chriſt hath the knowledg of the Father, and his love and Faithfulneſs in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner. Take a place or two which wil give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable teſtimony to this truth. Math. 11.25. <hi>No man knows the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son wil reveal him.</hi> Joh. 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen the Father at any time, but the only begotten Son, who was in the Boſom of the Father:</hi> He ſaw al his Boſom ſecrets, and was fully acquainted with Gods heart and counſels, he hath revealed them unto us. And therefore the Apoſtle iſſues al here: ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deep things of God. <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth the deep things of God,</hi> that is of the Father; but how come we to relliſh either the things of the Father or Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it? who hath known the mind of God?

               <p>For the right apprehending, how the Second Perſon may in a peculiar manner be ſaid <hi>to know the Father,</hi> we muſt conceive that the knowledg of Chriſt, as Second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, may be attended upon a double conſideration, or ground.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As it Iſſues from the underſtanding of the God-Head.</hi> For God, according to the expreſſion of the Scripture, being a Spirit, &amp; of al other moſt excellent, and therefore reaſonable, he muſt have the moſt excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: and therefore underſtanding and wil. For what is moſt eminent, that we have allowance, from the rule, to beleeve, that it doth belong to the God-Head, and we may ſo conceive of it.</p>
               <p>From this underſtanding it is, that the God-Head is ſaid to be Omniſcient, to know al things, that are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. This being an Attribute of the Deity, it doth equally belong to al the perſons: For al the Perſons having one and the ſame God-Head, they have equally al the Attributes of the God-Head indifferently, equally, belonging to them.

               <p>For it is not proper to ſay, That the God-Head
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:66082:175"/>knows the Father to be Father of it, with that ſpeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l reference; or that the God-Head ſhould cal the Father, my Father; I ſay it is not proper, nay it is not true.</p>
               <p>For the Father is not the Father of the God-Head, but of the Son.</p>
               <p>If it could cal the Father as Father of it: then it ſhould be the Son of the Father, then it ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father.</p>
               <p>But the Father begets the Son, not the God-Head.</p>
               <p>That which belongs to the God-Head, belongs to al the perſons, as being common: then to the Spirit. Then the ſpirit might know and cal the Father, the Father of it, but that he is not.</p>
               <p>That which belongs to the God-Head belongs to the Father, and ſo the Father might be a Son to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This knowledg is to be conſidered, according as it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the manner of the work of the underſtanding, which carries a ſpecialty of reſpect with it, in the act thereof, and ſo it may in a peculiar manner be affirmed of Father and Son, and in the ſeveral regards, appropriated unto either. The reaſon whereof we ſhal ſcan anon, as it comes in our way; when the underſtanding of the God-Head, by knowing it ſelf, conceiveth an image of it ſelf, makes an impreſs or engraven character of it ſelf, which it ever eyes; and owns, this manner of knowing belongs to the Father, and thence Iſſues an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of knowing the Father by and in the Son. As <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15.</p>
               <p>As the Father knows me, I know the Father. And that appears in a Three-fold act of the Son.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Son takes the Impreſſion of his Image.</item>
                  <item>2. Returnes it.</item>
                  <item>3. Eyes and ownes the Imprinter of it.</item>

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:66082:176"/>Sonſhip, and the nature of al relation requires, they give being each to other.</p>
               <p>The Father by underſtanding conceives an Image: the Son is the Image conceived. As a man is not a Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a man, but becauſe he begets a Son. A man is not a Son, becauſe he is a man, but becauſe he is begotten of a Father.</p>
               <p>So the God-Head is not a Father, becauſe God-Head, but becauſe it conceives an Image of it ſelf. The Son is not a Son, becauſe God, but becauſe he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of another who did conceive. This is the meaning of the Apoſtle.

                  </gap>, <hi>The Shine of his glory:</hi> the word ſignifies, a Light, or brightneſs ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from a Light: a ſhine from a light reflecting or looking back to that reflection of light again. And here by the way, ye have the riſe and reaſon of theſe divers manners of underſtanding in the God-Head, and ſo the diverſe ſubſiſtences, and Perſonalities, Namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the underſtanding of the God-Head, acting upon it ſelf, it becomes to be reflected and turned back upon it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:66082:176"/>
               <p>If there be a reflect act in the Deity upon it ſelf, then there muſt be divers manners of being in the Deity.</p>
               <p>But there is ſuch a reflecting; therefore, For the right underſtanding of this, ye muſt conceive the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the God-head, being pure act, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it muſt have a proportionable, and therefore an infinite Object: therefore underſtand himſelf, conceive an Image of himſelf; this Image of himſelf, muſt be conceived, and look back upon himſelf, or his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving again.</p>
               <p>Now that the ſhine of this Impreſſion muſt return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon it ſelf, and look back to the impreſſion, is thus made plain, by ſetting a diſ-ſimilitude by it. When the operative, active Wiſdom of God fals upon nothing; purpoſing to make a VVorld, it breaks through that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and brings forth an effect, a Creature out of it, ſtinted with bounds of being, and time; it's both finite, and temporary, hath a beginning of time, and may have an end.</p>
               <p>But this Underſtanding falling upon the God-head, which is abſolutely firſt, and infinite, it cannot break through, make an effect, or give this the Being of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being infinite, and firſt-being.</p>
               <p>The Act of Gods Wiſdom fals upon that as his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and returns again upon it ſelf, and ſo doth conceive, and hath an Image of it ſelf conceived, an engraven Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from this Impreſſion returned by reſemblance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Impreſſion.</p>
               <p>As take a beam of the Sun, meet with the Glaſs, it finds way, by reaſon of the perſpicuity of the body to paſs through it.</p>
               <p>But let it fal upon a firm, and ſolid body, pierce, and paſs it cannot: and therefore it fals upon the body, and returns upon it ſelf from the body: the falling is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting of it, and by returning, it comes to be reflected.</p>
               <p>Here note, The Light is one thing; but the reflecting, and returned, or to be reflected upon it ſelf, is another.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:66082:177"/>Theſe anſwer each the other, ſtir up the act, each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; no reflecting, no returning; no returning, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting. They give being to, and maintain being each in other: mark that, The reflecting, and being refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, is not the cauſe of the Light, but each of other.</p>
               <p>So here: The Wiſdom of the God-head, is like the Light reflecting upon it ſelf, there is a like Image of it ſelf returned again, and conceived. This being concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as it had al from the Father, ſo it eyes, and anſwers al in the Father conceiving.</p>
               <p>A man may underſtand a Truth, but when by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he darts it upon his mind to enlighten, and ſo teach and rectifie: The mind receives, and ſtands recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and enlightened The Underſtanding is one thing, but the darting by Underſtanding, rectifying, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening; the mind returning, and ſtanding rectified, theſe are divers manners really diſtinct, and directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering each the other in a peculiar manner.</p>
               <p>Thus our Savior is ſaid to manifeſt the Name of the Father, not his Name as God, but as Father. As I ſaid before: The Light is not the cauſe of the reflecting, or returning; but one of theſe, is the cauſe of the other: reflecting is the cauſe of returning, and returning is the cauſe of reflecting.</p>
               <p>So the Underſtanding is not the cauſe of Teaching, for that may be where no teaching is: but Teaching, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Knowledg, is the cauſe why Knowledg comes to be rectified. So that Phraſe; <hi>No man knows the Son, but he to whom the Father will reveal him; and no man knows the Father, but he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> No man knows what the rectifying of the Knowledg is, but he who hath his Knowledg recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And this is to be attended, according to the Second Perſon in the Deity; for it's true both waies, as wel of the Father, who was never incarnate, as of the Son, who was.</p>

               <p>He that hath his Mind rectified by a Truth, wil own the rectifying, or teaching while he lives, <hi>John,</hi> 10.15. <hi>The Father knows me, and I know the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How this belongs to our Savior, as Man, as well as the Second Perſon:</hi> For ſo he looks at himſelf, and in that reſpect, and conſideration, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Expreſſion here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Knowledg belongs firſtly to the Son as Second Perſon; but to the Humane Nature ſo far, as the Relation of Son-ſhip leaves ſome impreſſion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature, and Condition thereof. So that the Second Perſon in the Trinity, is no other, nor acts any otherwiſe than he did in himſelf. But this manner of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in the knowledg of the Father, appears in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and leave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And that is done in regard of that Union, that the Humane Nature hath to the Second Perſon: For as we know, the Second Perſon takes the Humane Nature into perſonal Union with him, ſo that there is not two Sons, but one Son: and the Lord Chriſt remains the ſame Perſon after the Union, that he was before. And therefore being one and the ſame Perſon with the Son, he may be ſaid to know the Father, as the Son, in his manner and meaſure.</p>
               <p>For as the Father gives being to the Son, and the Son receives al from the Father: ſo the Humane Nature hath
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:66082:178"/>a total dependance upon the Son, he only incarnate, and ſo a ſole reference with that reſpect to him, and ſo in him, to the Father: So that it is ſaid, to be one and the ſame Perſon, one and the ſame Son, with the Son.</p>

As to be reflected, is ſaid to be the property of the Second Perſon, looking back, and returning his ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence to the Father: So our Nature having a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Chriſt in the Union, and being one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with him, looks as the Second Perſon wholly to the Father: <hi>He brings back</hi> Jacob. Nay, it eyes, and owns, through the Son, al thoſe Fatherly Impreſſions, and Affections, which are in the Father, and wherein he intimately unboſoms himſelf to his Son.

He that hath intelligence dayly from ſuch, as have the Ear of the King, ſit at Counſel-Table, he in the Boſom of his Majeſty; if he have an expreſs, and Intelligence, it's no wonder; becauſe he underſtands the Myſteries of State, the mind of the King.

                  <p>We have done with the Firſt. The Second follows:</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>—And theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here is another Circumſtance touching the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parties for whom our Savior praies, which may yet further his Petition, that it may be of prevailing force with the Father, for the grant of his deſire (to wit) That they may be where he is, and ſee his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Had they indeed been the wicked of the World, who never knew the Father, nor himſelf, and therefore were never fit, nor able to ſee his Glory, or to take any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in it, or to return any Glory to the Father, or himſelf thereby: It had been bootleſs for him to have begged ſuch a favor, and it had been impoſſible for them to receive any good by it, as having no intereſt therein, nor fitneſs for the enjoyment of ſuch a Priviledg.</p>
                  <p>But he praies, who knows him as a Son, knows his Father, yea, ſuch a Son, ſuch a Father, known by an Eternal Generation.</p>
                  <p>And he praies for ſuch, who know that the Father hath ſent him; and therefore are wel acquainted with him and the Father, and with the Ambaſſage he comes of, and with that great Work which he had undertaken, and hath now diſcharged, and for which he ſhal have a Name, that at the Name of Jeſus, every knee ſhal bow, both in Heaven and Earth. And therefore they who know what the Father hath purpoſed, and the Son hath performed, and that experimentally to their own good; They are the fitteſt to ſee it, and to celebrate the Name of the Father and Son for ever in Heaven.</p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Sending, is the firſt in-let, whereby the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the ever laſting good Wil, and Favor of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is laid open, and let out unto us: And you ſhal find the Spirit in the Scripture leading al his by the hand hither; here he would Land us, and here leave us, and thereby teaching of us, that we ſhould not ſtay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we repair hither, and when we are here, not to ſtir: But reſt, and repoſe our Soul, and reſolve our Faith, and Confidence, as into the firſt Principle; where there is no poſſibility, either of alteration, or addition: So firm, it cannot be altered; ſo fully ſufficient, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, that nothing can be added, nor deſired.</p>
               <p>It is too myſterious a depth, and therefore beyond our ſcantling to fathom it. We wil a little, make ſome ſearch with Sobriety, ſo far as may help us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the place in hand.</p>
               <p>Thus our Savior makes it the Head Corner Stone of our Confidence: <hi>This is Eternal Life, to know thee</hi> (that is, the Father) <hi>to be only God</hi> (not he only to be God, but to be the only God) there is but one only Deity, and he hath that only God-head, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide? <hi>and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Know him as a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> annointed, and fitted; and as a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a Savior, who hath performed the work; and that he is
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:66082:180"/>
                  <hi>ſent</hi> for that very <hi>End,</hi> and Errand, and for that purpoſe from God the Father.</p>
               <p>For had our Savior <hi>done it,</hi> if he had not been ſent, the Soul would have been at a loſs, whether he had ever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, or ſhould ever be accepted.</p>
               <p>But when our Faith can reach this: That the Father, who is the only God, hath ſent him, he wil then aſſiſt, and accept, and we ſhould go no further, ſeek no other; we then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it down, and are at reſt, <hi>John,</hi> 12.44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We ſhall therefore make way for the Diſcovery of the Nature of this Sending, by the Propoſitions following:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This Sending,</hi> taken in a ful Senſe, is not an Act of the Deity, or Divine Nature properly; but of the Perſon, or Perſons in the Deity, who nextly, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpenſeth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> That which is an Act of the Deity, or God-head, belongs indifferently, and equally to al the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; in that al are equally God, and have the Eſſence of the Deity, and al the Eſſential Attributes, equally attributed to them al. As al are <hi>Eternal, Omnipotent;</hi> all <hi>Create, Decree, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſend (much leſs to ſend the Lord Chriſt) doth not belong to al the Perſons: The Spirit is never ſaid to ſend in the Phraſe of Scripture, nor is the Father ever ſaid to be ſent. And this ſhal be further cleared and proved in the Concluſions that follow; and by the Nature of Miſſion, as it's ſet forth to us in the Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Sending hath a double Reference.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To the Perſon that is ſent.</item>
                     <item>2. To the thing about which he is ſent: namely, When the Perſon ſent, leaves a new act, or impreſſion upon the Creature: ſo that the Creature is ſaid to be otherwiſe than it was, and to have ſomthing which formerly it had not, and the Perſon is ſent on purpoſe, to leave ſuch operations, and impressions.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:66082:181"/>
               <p>God ſent his Son made of a Woman, ſent him to take our Nature: here the ſecond perſon takes our Nature into perſonal union with him. Sanctifies it, unites it, ſupports it.</p>
               <p>Though Chriſt be the ſame, yet here be new impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which appear in the Creature, which formerly did not. <hi>I wil ſend the Comforter, and be ſhal teach you and lead you into al truth.</hi> Here be <hi>new</hi> and <hi>diverſe</hi> expreſſions of the work of the Spirit appearing, which formerly did not. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.10.11. The ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect implies ever the firſt; the ſending to a work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a perſon that muſt be, and is ſent to that end: though then theſe may be diſtinguiſhed, in our reaſon and conſideration, yet in the Nature of the thing, the one is included in the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sending, when it reſpects a Perſon properly,</hi> It ever implies in the Nature of the thing, <hi>The Authority of him that ſends, in reſpect of the party that is ſent.</hi> I ſay Authority, but not of rule or Dominion ſo much, as Authority of Order &amp; Communication of work from one to another, and in this ſenſe; which is a proper and true ſenſe; he only can be ſaid to be ſent, who works from another: whether it be in way of Origination, or firſtneſs of Order; to be firſt beginner or ſetter in of a work before al other: or whether it be in regard of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or active production when ſeveral perſons may, as one Joint principle, put forth a work, for the producing. They are not one in order before another, but both meet as one principle and producer or bringer forth of the other; And therefore hence it is plain, and undeniably Evident (which ye muſt eſpecially obſerve) that in this breadth and extent of ſending, which the Scripture ſpeaks to, The Son and the Spirit are only ſaid to be ſent, and it is never, and indeed it can never be, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father.</p>
               <p>If ſending imply Authority of Order and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:66082:181"/>of work from another, then there is none can ſend the Father, becauſe there is none in Order before him: nor can he be ſent, becauſe he works of himſelf, and from himſelf, nor from another, therefore cannot be ſent from another.</p>
               <p>Hence again it follows: The Spirit may be ſent from the Father and the Son, and the Father and the Son may ſent: becauſe the Spirit, the Holy Ghoſt works in Order from both, and there is Authority of Order and communication from both. Gal. 4.6. <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of the Son.</hi> That is, the Father, as appears by the diſtinction of Son in the words. Joh. 15.26. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I wil ſend unto you from the Father.</hi> Joh. 14.26. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom the Father wil ſend in my Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence Chriſt can only be ſaid to be ſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not of the Holy Ghoſt (I ſpeak now of this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſending, which is attended only in regard of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not of the thing, about which he is ſent) the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ground is the ſame.</p>
               <p>Sending implies the Authority of Order and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of work from one to another: but the Son works only from the Father, therefore can be ſaid only to be ſent from the Father.</p>
               <p>Hence are there ſo many expreſſions and confeſſions of our Savior in this kind, almoſt in every verſe, when he would ſettle his commiſſion. Joh. 5.30. <hi>I ſeek not mine own Wil, but the Wil of my Father which ſent me.</hi> And verſe, 36. <hi>I have greater witneſs than that of</hi> John: <hi>for the works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, they bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> This <hi>ſending</hi> of our Savior is the firſt of al others, and makes way for al other ſending, or ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual good things, that are ſent unto us from God.</p>
               <p>Have this, have al: make ſure of this, make ſure of
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:66082:182"/>al: maintaine this, maintain a certain intercourſe and Communication of al good things unto our Souls from the Lord. This is the firſt out filet of God everlasting love and goodneſs. 1 Joh: 4.9.<hi>God ſo loved us, that he ſent his only begotten Son &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no expectation of the Spirit, there is mo poſſibility of having, no, in truth of the ſending of the Spirit, but only by this way, and upon this ground Joh. 16.7. <hi>It behooves that I go away, for unleſs I go, the Spirit wil not come unto you, but if I go, I wil ſend him.</hi> No coming of the ſpirit, unleſs he had firſt come. Unleſs he go to Heaven, no ſending of the Spirit from Heaven.</p>
               <p>As it is true for the meaſure in regard of his aſcenſion: ſo it is true, for the reality of the thing, in regard of his <hi>Miſſion</hi> from the Father. For the ſpirit muſt be ſent from the Father and the Son: And therefore it preſumes his ſending. And Hence it is, when he is come, being ſent of the Father, <hi>He ſhal teach you al things, and ſhal bring to mind, what ever I have ſaid to you.</hi> And that which Chriſt ſpeaks, he hath from the Father, not from the Spirit. Joh. 14.10. — <hi>The words he ſpeaks not of himſelf.</hi> And Verſe, 24. <hi>The words which ye hear are not mine, but the Fathers which ſent me;</hi> He hath the meſſage from him. Joh. 12.49. <hi>I have not ſpeken of my ſelf, but the Father, which ſent me, gave me a command what I ſhal ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay our Savior doth not take of the Spirit, but the Spirit hears from him, ſpeaks from him. Joh. 16.13. <hi>Howbeit, when the Spirit of truth is come he wil guid you into al truth.</hi> For he ſhal not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatever he ſhal hear, that ſhal he ſpeak. He ſhal take of mine, and ſhew it unto you. Verſe, 15. Chriſt doth not go to take of the graces from the Spirit: but the Spirit, becauſe Chriſt is ſent to be the Head of the Church, to have al Grace, and to be the Fountain
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:66082:182"/>to communicate al Grace, therefore the Spirit takes of his. Not takes of the Father, becauſe the Father hath given al to him, but takes of his, who hath his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Father, and is ſent out his work, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>The ſending of al Officers is hence. <hi>As my Father ſent me, I ſend you:</hi> And this is the order and Method of Gods Communication: <hi>He that receives you, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him that ſent me.</hi> Yea the ſending of Goſpel and al ordinances. Joh. 17.8. <hi>For I have given unto them the words thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known and beleeved that thou didſt ſend me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea the ground of al thoſe glorious works he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in his own Perſon, and wil perform for his, and againſt his enemies for their good, is hence. Joh. 9.4. I <hi>muſt do the works of him that ſent me, while it is day.</hi> And 5.36. <hi>The works which the Father hath given me to do, bear witneſs, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> And when he had fulfilled al, he then returnes to his Father.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As ſending evidenceth an Authority in him that ſends: <hi>So to be ſent implies, that he that is ſent takes this Authoritative Order, ſtands ingaged to anſwer it, thus given and taken,</hi> And is fully to act under the will of him, from whom he muſt work. And thus it is with the Lord Chriſt, as ſecond perſon in the glorious Trinity, being ſent by God the Father, to work as from him.</p>
               <p>For as the manner of their being, ſo is the manner of their working: the Son from the Father, and therefore works from the Father: he is ready to entertain this Order of working, and ingageth himſelf to anſwer the Order and wil of the Father, and ſtands fitted to have the Nature of man united to him, that he may go upon the operation of that work of the Father, according to the Order of the Father given him, and al this in a
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:66082:183"/>peculiar manner appropriate to the Son.</p>
               <p>What ever belongs to the Second Perſon, and none els, that he hath as a Son received from the Father.</p>
               <p>But to act by Authoritative order form the Father alone: belongs to the Second Perſon and none els.</p>
               <p>Therefore this as a Son he hath received from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Therefore as he muſt act from him alone: ſo he is bound to anſwer that Order of his.</p>
               <p>Therefore works nothing, but what he ſees, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work: ſpeaks nothing but what he hears his Father ſay.</p>
               <p>Therefore does nothing, but what the Father wil.</p>
               <p>Therefore to be fitted, when his wil is, to take the Nature of man into Perſonal union that he may go upon the execution of his wil.</p>
               <p>I ſay receive it into perſonal union. Becauſe this belongs to no other Perſon, not Father, nor Holy Ghoſt but himſelf. For its Haereſie to ſay, the Father is incarnate or the Holy Ghoſt is incarnate. How ever therefore he did not receive the Human Nature, but in time: Yet he was fitted for this work, by this ſending and eternal miſſion of his before al time: this makes way for that work of Redemption,</p>
               <p>The Human Nature hath a new manner of ſubſiſtence and alteration, according to its being, but there is no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Second Perſon. As Gods power is the ſame before the things were made: though they cannot be ſupported, but when they are made.</p>
               <p>Again when the Human Nature is united; this union we know is in reaſon reall, <hi>me non cogitante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the proper being of the union iſſued only from the Human Nature, then there ſhould be no difference, in regard of the perſons, but they ſhould ſhare a like in it.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:66082:183"/>But that is falſe and Heretical. For neither Father, nor Holy Ghoſt are incarnate. Nor is the Human Nature taken into perſonal union or becomes one perſon with the Father on Holy Ghoſt. Therefore there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this union iſſues from the Second Perſon in an eſpecial manner; and that is to receive it into perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al union: for which he was fitted from eternity by his miſſion, but takes it up in the fulneſs of time, when he was ſent by the Father thereunto.</p>
               <p>Some ſuch thing I have thought might be intimated in thoſe Scriptures; Joh. 8.42. and 17.8. and 13.2. <hi>He came out, proceeded from God,</hi> When he was to enter upon the Execution of the work, and make the Human Nature feele that ſupport, Leaning, and being termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the ſubſiſtence of the Second Perſon, and went abroad in the execution of the work, and therefore now he returnes to God again.</p>
               <p>Laſtly this ſending in regard of the work upon the Creature: This concluſion may give ſome light, as much as ſhal ſerve our purpoſe. The Lord Chriſt as God and man hath ſome things proper to himſelf:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the manner of the work and Priviledg, where with he ſtands poſſeſſed, he is the head of his Church, and hath the immediate diſpenſation of al power committed to him for the good of it, and theſe are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar. He is the Head of his Church. None but he. Al power is committed to him, and to none but him. But in regard of the work there is a common concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of al the Perſons with him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>For what he is ſent.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>See and be ſwallowed up with the wonderment of Gods love to ſuch worthleſs ones, as we. Had he ſent his letters to comfort, his Creatures to viſite, his Angels to adminiſter, it had been more than we worthleſs worms could have expected. So the Apoſtle. 1 Joh. 4.9, 10. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in that he ſent his Son.</hi> If any man queſtion his love, or desire to ſee the diſcovery of love: <hi>In this</hi> its manifeſted undeniably, infallibly. Love unmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unconceivable, that he ſhould ſend his own Son, from his own boſom, to ſuch worthleſs duſt.</p>
                  <p>In this is Love, herein is Love, it's here to be adored, admired for ever. <hi>Not that we loved him:</hi> for that had been Love, to have owned us, and accepted of us, <hi>But that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins. Elizabeth</hi> is drawn to a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the coming of <hi>Mary: How comes it, that the Mother of my Lord, cometh unto me?</hi> Luke, 1.43. But how cometh it, that the Lord himſelf come? It's more than is uſually obſerved, or indeed can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that a man ſhould ſend a choyce Pearl from his Cloſet, a Diamond out of his Cabinet. But that one ſhould ſend his whol Treaſure, it's more than can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, Or deſired.</p>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:66082:184"/>
                  <p>But it's ſo here: God hath ſent his Son, in whom al the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg are his; and to us ſo vile, ſo unthankful, and unworthy.</p>
                  <p>Nay, as God, when he would convince Satan of <hi>Jobs</hi> Sincerity, he impannels a Jury from Hel; tels him, that he had moved him to afflict <hi>Job</hi> without a Cauſe: for yet he held his Innocency, and the Devil could not deny it.</p>
                  <p>So conſider here for thy ſhame, if thy heart ſtir not with admiration, we ſhal impannel a Jury from Hel, which wil give in a Verdict.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. At the day of Judgment, <hi>God ſhal be Glorious in all his Saints, but admired in them that believe.</hi> When al the wicked ſhal be gathered at the left hand of Chriſt, the Devils, and damned Spirits, and al the rabble of thoſe fulſom Goats, ſhal ſee the poor Saints, ſuch as were oppoſite to Chriſt, haters of him, to be made one with him: They who rejected, nay, may be, perſecuted Chriſt, and the means of Grace, to be now made partakers of Chriſt and Grace: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils wil admire this mercy, though they never ſhare in it; and ſhalt not thou admire it, who art partaker of it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Comfort,</hi> of never failing aſſurance of our ſafety and happineſs. It's the wil of the Father, and that muſt ſtand; and Chriſt is ſent to do his wil, and he wil not fail of doing that, for which he was appointed; and therefore thou canſt not fail of Heaven. Chriſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth (<hi>John,</hi> 6.38, 39.) he came to do the Wil of the Father, and this is his Wil, That he ſhould loſe none, but raiſe them up at the laſt day; and he reſolves he wil loſe none, but he wil raiſe them up, verſe 40.</p>

For ſo the Text intimates, and our Savior ſpeaks of it in that regard.</p>
                  <p>The World knows thee not, they never attained this Learning, nor were trained, and taught up to it: they are amongſt the Petties, and Punies of the world, and may have ſome worldly wiſdom.

                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This Knowledg is peculiar to the Saints,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:66082:185"/>of that <hi>ſpecial Ability, which they do receive from God,</hi> in ſpecial manner, by which their Judgments are cleered, and their Underſtandings enabled to ſearch and ſee into ſuch myſterious depths, and ſecret Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God unto the Souls of his, in the Covenant of his Grace, and the Conveyance of his Mercy; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and over-flies the moſt Eagle-ſighted Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of any Natural Man in the World.</p>
                  <p>They have the wiſdom, and enlightening Grace of the Spirit in their Minds, and the concurrence, and aſſiſtance of the Spirit, to act and lead them out, and thereby to lead them into al Truths: and theſe muſt not be ſevered, becauſe God hath joined them together, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.2, 3. There muſt not be Lamps only to burn in the Golden Candle-ſtick; but there muſt be Olive Trees, to feed thoſe Lamps, and to further their Light in their dayly burning. As that is true in the Church of Chriſt, it's true alſo in the heart of every Member of the Church, there is not only a Lamp of Knowledg burning in the Mind, but there muſt be alſo a conſtant ſupply of the Oyl of the Spirit, which muſt quicken, and act out that Spiritual Wiſdom, for the right diſcerning of the things of our Peace. And this is the Condition of al the Saints, and the ordinary courſe of Gods Diſpenſation of himſelf, in the way of the Goſpel. He hath given us a mind to know him, ſaies the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 5.20 he hath given his Spirit, ſaies <hi>Paul,</hi> whereby we may know the things, that are graciouſly given us of God. This is the end of giving both, without which, it cannot be. So the words run, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>We have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly given us of God,</hi> q.d. There is no man of the world, who only hath the Spirit of the world, that can know ſuch things: None of the Princes of the World knew them, verſe 8. nay, no Natural Man can know them, verſe 14.</p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:66082:186"/>
                  <p>But the Spirit ſearcheth the deep things of God. There be depths of the warmings of our minds and hearts, and none but the Spirit of God can diſcover them: deep things in the mind of God, and whoever knew his mind? No Creature ever did, or could; but Chriſt knew his mind, and we have the mind of Chriſt, and ſo come to know the mind of the Father, verſe 16. And hence our Savior ſurveys the differencing Reaſon, why his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might perceive; others, as Scribes and Phariſees, had eyes, and could not ſee. <hi>To you it is given to know the things of the Kingdom, but not to them:</hi> and upon this ground our Savior adviſeth the Church of <hi>Laodicea: I counſel thee, to buy of me Eye-ſalve, to annoint thine Eyes, that thou mayeſt ſee.</hi> This Spiritual, and ſpecial, Super-natural Light, is that Eye-ſalve, which al the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our-Savior had, and therefore they knew him. As the Sun is ſeen by his own Light: It muſt be the wiſdom from above, that muſt enable us to ſee the things that are above. So <hi>John,</hi> 14.17. <hi>The World hath not ſeen, nor known the Comforter, but ye know him,</hi> that is, by the Light of the Spirit, ye come to ſee the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the <hi>thing known,</hi> there is a <hi>Specialty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</hi> They look at it, as an Ambaſſage <hi>of Love, and Life,</hi> which the Lord Chriſt now brings from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who intends their good in both, and our Savior comes on purpoſe to work it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A meſſage of love for the Soul of a ſinner under the ſight and ſenſe of the guilt of his iniquity, he doth, and cannot but apprehend God as an angry God againſt him, that there be many cauſes of quarrel and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, that God hath lying by him, and indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie lies between the Father and the ſinner: becauſe his work was directly wronged and prejudiced. And Hence its evident, that the meſſage muſt come from the Father, touching the terms and purpoſe of peace, if ever
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:66082:186"/>it be attained, becauſe it is the Wrath and Juſtice of the Lord that proclaims War againſt the ſinner, having juſtly deſerved that his diſpleaſure ſhould break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Chriſt is the Prince of Peace, who is our Peace, and takes up the Quarrel between the Father, and the Elect, brings the glad tidings of Grace from God, who not only tenders, but deſires reconciliation with the Soul, through Jeſus. And therefore he muſt come as an Ambaſſador ſent from the Father, and that the Soul muſt know; or elſe he could not attain his end, take up the Controverſie betwixt the Father and him.</p>
                  <p>So among al Nations, it is a received courſe in Reaſon, the Ambaſſador muſt come from the Prince offended, that hath intended War; and he muſt make known the Commiſſion of his Ambaſſage, as from him Authorized, elſe Peace and Agreement wil never be accompliſhed, nor received. So 1 <hi>John,</hi> 4.9. See alſo <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his Son, &amp;c.</hi> How is that to be proved? He anſwers; For God ſent his Son, not that he might condemn the World; for they condemn themſelves; but that the World might live through him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are Riddles to the wicked, they may be talked of in the World, the noiſe of ſuch things may go up and down: But to know, and own the Ambaſſage, as ſent on purpoſe to him, this is a Secret peculiar to the Saints. As it was ſaid, <hi>My Meſſage is to thee, O Captain,</hi> 2 Kings, 9. The reſt heard it, but he came to the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al underſtanding of it. So it is here.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>John</hi> 15.21. <hi>This they will do unto you, becauſe they know not him that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A Meſſage of Life.</hi> For the ſinner once ſeriouſly apprehenſive of his many, and conſtant departures from God, his provocations are ſo ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ous, that he cannot but
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:66082:187"/>ſee death in al his waies, he can do nothing, but he ſins in al he doth, and therefore the wages of ſin, being death, he muſt die for what he hath done, if God ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſeverity againſt him, and recompence his own waies upon his own Head.</p>
                  <p>Therefore having forfeited his Life into the hands of Divine Juſtice, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Father, whom he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked: Chriſt muſt come as an Ambaſſador from the Father, and he muſt know he hath a Commiſſion, and a grant of Life under the Fathers hand, elſe his Ambaſſage wil be in vain, wil not accompliſh the end intended by him, and expected by the Faithful Party: He hath ſent his <hi>Son, that we might live through him,</hi> 1 John, 4.9. This is the Record, that God hath <hi>given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son,</hi> Chap. 5.11. It's the Fathers Gift, it belongs to the ſame Power, and place of Majeſty, to give pardon, and ſo Life to a Malefactor; or to take Life from him, <hi>John,</hi> 6.57. <hi>As the living hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> See the Order.</p>
                  <p>The Father is the Fountain of Life. He as a living God, ſends Chriſt upon an Ambaſſage of Life. Chriſt hath received power of Life from the Father, and he as ſo ſent, gives to thoſe that beleeve in him.</p>
                  <p>The Faithful know this Commiſſion of Life, and that it is come out on purpoſe, and intended to them, as he to <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 6.23. <hi>Peace be unto thee, fear not, thou ſhalt not die.</hi> And they know, and own Chriſt, as ſo ſent. All which are Myſteries to the wicked, they ſee no need of this; or if ſo, they neither own it in Chriſt, nor would receive it from him: They may hear the fame thereof, and yet know nothing, either of the Excellency of it, or of Gods Intendment of any good to them in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Specialty of this Knowledg, appears <hi>in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of communicating this good,</hi> to the Souls of the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:66082:187"/>Faithful; namely, <hi>The aſtoniſhing Excellency of Power,</hi> that brings the reality of theſe Ambaſſages of Love and Life to the Soul; and the <hi>dazelling beauty of that Light that diſplaies them,</hi> and laies them open to the Eye of the beleeving Saint. Which things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the World, and therefore they count them fooliſhneſs; becauſe they could never conceive, or be perſwaded of any ſuch thing. They think they cannot be, becauſe they cannot perceive how they ſhould be. As <hi>Nicodemus, How can theſe things be?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We wil give a little Light to both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They find ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> as puts them to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For the Meſſage of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> are of ſuch unconceivable worth in themſelves, and ſo far beyond the thoughts of a ſinner, that they ſhould be ſent from God, who is offended with them, and was, and is happy without them, and hath no need of them: and that by no other hand, but by the Lord Jeſus, the Son of his Love, bleſſed for ever: and that to ſuch, as they are, ſo unworthy, and vile in themſelves, ſo loathſom, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, by reaſon of the Number, and Nature of their Helliſh Iniquities. That it ſeems ſo croſs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of al Reaſon, that they cannot but cavil at it, as a thing abſurd and unreaſonable to beleeve, and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful and guilty hearts cannot but reject it, as a thing impoſſible. Yea, the Diſciples themſelves, when the hardneſs of the work was reſembled by a compariſon from our Savior, they cried out, <hi>Who then can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make known, and make good this Ambaſſage to the Soul, God muſt make known his Almighty Power to the ſinner, which he only that feels, is forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; others cannot conceive. So <hi>Paul</hi> to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Chap. 1.17. &amp;c. praies for a Spirit of Wiſdom, and Revelation; another Spirit, and common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, cannot come neer ſuch things. That they might know the <hi>exceſſive, exceeding great Activity</hi> of the
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:66082:188"/>might <hi>Power of God</hi> in bringing a ſinner home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, verſe 19. and therefore the Convert, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. when he hath but a glimpſe hereof, in the ſearch of the Secrets of his own heart, he fals down, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>God is in you of a Truth.</hi> It's the Wiſdom, Power, Soveraignty of a God. It's beyond al created Power, ever to diſcover ſuch things, to work ſo upon the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Power, that ſettles the Meſſage, ſo the <hi>Light</hi> that diſcovers the Beauties, and Excellencies that are therein, utterly beyond apprehenſion, expectation, admiration. <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſeth that the <hi>very Angels of Heaven, pry into theſe Secrets,</hi> delight to lie down, and look wiſhly into them, becauſe they lie ſo low and deep, beyond their diſcerning, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. yea, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul concludes, the Eye never ſaw, the Ear never heard, nay, it never entred into the heart of man to conceive th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the reality and ſubſtance of what hath been ſaid, it appertains to al: though there be much difference in the manner and meaſure, how theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries come to be diſpenſed.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But we ſee by experience, many of Gods own, are Ignorant here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a diſcovery of theſe in a manner and meaſure to al: for al have that ſpiritual light, all have notice of that Ambaſſage of peace of love, and of life, brought them in, and by Chriſt: and by that overbearing power and light, thoſe good things of Chriſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are diſcovered ſo convictingly, and ſet on ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, that the heart is kept to them. By ſuch a knowledg they come to be apprehended, and receive.</p>
                  <p>But there is a reflect act, when our underſtanding views and looks over the work of the mind and heart, ſo that we <hi>know</hi> that we do <hi>know,</hi> and know that we do receive. This the Saints may, and do want many times for ſome while.</p>
                  <p>We have this diſpatcht the four Particulars and ſo cleared our way to the underſtanding of the Doctrine propoſed, which was; The Saints have a ſpecial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the Lord Chriſt is ſent of God the Father for the work of their Salvation. We ſhal now proceed to the Reaſons and Uſes in few words</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of the point is double</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Office of our Savior,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> and the <hi>Aim</hi> and ſcope <hi>he hath</hi> in the execution of the work thereof. He comes not to do his own wil, nor to ſeek his own glory, but to do the wil, and ſeek the glory of him that ſent him. Therefore he muſt diſpenſe al, as from him, draw al Eyes and hearts towards him. For the Nature of an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:66082:189"/>doth of neceſſity imply and require this. It makes al to look to the perſon who ſends the Ambaſſage, whoſe power and pleaſure is there firſtly attended: and leads al by the hand, ſo that they muſt not reſt in their returns, until they come to the Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The heart of a ſinner cannot be <hi>quieted,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Soul cannot <hi>find reſt,</hi> or repoſe, before it be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to God the Father. Joh. 12.49, 50. And Chap. 11.42.</p>

                  <p>It teacheth the Saints to acknowledg with al thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that inlarged favor of the Lord towards them, that he would vouchſafe ſo choice and peculiar Priviledges to them, which he denies to al the world beſide: That he wil familiarize himſelf to them, and admit them into his preſence, when he doth eſtrange himſelf from al others. It's no ſmal part of reſpects, but an argument and evidence of peculiar and indeared reſpect; that when no man may come to the ſpeech or ſight of the King, He no ſooner comes to Court, but he may come into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and be acquainted with the Secrets of Sate. Nay, if he come, no ſooner is notice given, but he may have entrance at the firſt appearance; when he wil be ſeen by none of the Court, or Kingdom beſide.</p>
                  <p>This is your Priviledg, O ye bleſſed of the Lord; when the Lord locks up himſelf, and withdraws the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his preſence from the greateſt part, yea, from al the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The World know him not;</hi> yet ye do know him, and may be acquainted with al his ſecret purpoſes, touching his diſpenſations of the greateſt Affairs of the world, his counſels touching the Salvation, and damnation of men.</p>
                  <p>This made <hi>Judas</hi> at a stand, (not <hi>Iſcariot.) Why wilt thou ſhew thy ſelf to us, and not unto the World?</hi> They

                  <p>It's ever an Evidence of ſpecial regard, and intimate Confederacy, when King or State holds conſtant intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and correſpondence by Agents, and Ambaſſadors with one State, but recals them from al other, So it is here. Ye have an expreſs of the good pleaſure, and al the Affairs of Peace and Life, that are tranſacted in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, mannaged and committed to Chriſt, ye may know the mind of God, when he imparts no ſuch privacies to any ungodly Perſon whatſoever.</p>

                  <p>Hence we may diſcern, whether we be of the Scum, and Reffuſe of the World; or the Favorites, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, for whom he praies, and Heaven is prepared. This is an Evidence, a never failing one, whereby the Followers of Chriſt may be known; They know God in Chriſt, and al his purpoſes of good, which he hath ſent his Son to ſee accompliſhed for their good.</p>
                  <p>This our Savior makes the Ear-mark, the Brand-mark of his Flock, <hi>John</hi> 10.3, 4.27. <hi>His Sheep know his Voyce;</hi> they own the mind of God in his Word, and they wil honor him; and ſo the good Shep-heard is diſcerned by the like; <hi>I am the good Shepheard, who know mine, and am known of mine,</hi> verſe 14.

                  <p>This Knowledg diſcovers it ſelf by Two Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Effect</hi> of it. <hi>They will not follow a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> Strange Teachers, and ſtrange Doctrines, they do not own, they wil not follow; and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives this as a certain Demonſtration; They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us; for had they been of us, they would never have gone from us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. Nay, the Apoſtle goes further, and his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is dreadful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>The juſt by Faith, will hold out; but if any man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him;</hi> and therefore he quits his hands of that evil, bleſſeth himſelf from that. <hi>But we are not of thoſe that draw back unto Perdition.</hi> If that be their way, Perdition wil be their end. It's a direful Doom, which <hi>Peter</hi> ſets down, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the <hi>Means, and riſe of it.</hi> It <hi>iſſues from the word received into the heart.</hi> I gave them thy Word, and they received it, and know, &amp;c. And <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10, 11. and Chap. 4.6. <hi>Forſake her not, and ſhe will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thee; love her, and ſhe will keep thee.</hi> It's that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>When ye received the Word of God, ye received it not as the Word of men; but as the Word of God:</hi> Receive the Word, not as a Veſſel doth Water, but as a Woman doth a Perſon whom ſhe marrieth; receive it, to keep it, to live and die with it; and then it wil work effectually. But we entertain it, as a Paſſenger, as a Neighbor; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes and goes: we never have hearts engaged to it; if we had, we ſhould underſtand every good Path, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.9. Therefore our Savior gives the Reaſon, <hi>John,</hi> 5.43. <hi>I came in my Fathers Name, and ye will
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:66082:191"/>not receive me.</hi> Another comes in his own Name, and him ye wil receive.</p>
                  <p>We have now finiſhed the Second and Third General, obſerved in the opening of theſe two Verſes, viz. <hi>The Parties for whom this Prayer is made,</hi> which were deſcribed by way of diſ-ſimilitude to the World; and by their Effects, their Worth, and Excellency of Knowledg, and Grace. And <hi>The Party who makes the Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Branch, as it lies in the order of the words, which was the Fourth general Obſervation, is, <hi>The Means here uſed,</hi> and that which is reſolved on, to be improved for the attaining of the end, which is ſought for, with ſuch earneſtneſs in this Prayer: and this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in theſe words:</p>
               </div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div n="26" type="verse">
            <head>
               <hi>Verſe 26.</hi> I have made known thy Name to them, and will make it known.</head>
            <p>IN the words, there ſeems to be the Conſideration of a double end: One is by way of Prevention, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a ſecret Demand, How the Faithful, and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt, come to attain that Knowledg, which is hid from the World, and whether it were Knowledg of the right make, or no? Both which, he reſolves from hence; That he, who only doth know aright, he doth make known the Name of the Father to them; whence it comes that they both muſt know, and alſo know in a right and ſaving manner: For ſo good a Teacher, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power, and ſufficiency to make wiſe unto Salvation, cannot but make them good Schollers. Another End is, To ſet home with further Evidence, the main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:66082:191"/>in the foregoing Verſe, That the Faithful may be with him, where he is, and ſo may ſee the Glory gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by God the Father: For if he hath for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, made them know the Name of the Father, and is reſolved, and doth engage himſelf, that he wil not ceaſe further dayly to inform them, until he hath made them perfect in this Knowledg: then are they fitteſt to be partakers of that happineſs to be with him, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Glory. But t his he hath done, and reſolves ſtil further to do: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We have then, theſe two Things here to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Work of our Savior, what he hath done: <hi>He hath made known this Name:</hi> that is, for time paſt.</item>
                  <item>2. The Profeſſion, and Engagement of Chriſt, what he wil do for time to come: <hi>He will make it known.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To the Firſt: <hi>I have made known thy Name to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine we ſhal obſerve from hence, it this: Viz.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>To make known the Name of the Father to the truly humbled Soul,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> is a Work in a peculiar manner, appropriate to our Savior Chriſt.</head>
               <p>I ſay, in a peculiar manner appropriate to our Savior; in that he takes it here unto himſelf, as a part of that Prerogative Royal, that doth appertain to him: I have made known; I wil make known: As though this Trade were wholly, and only in his hand; this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:66082:192"/>and Science were only taught in Chriſt School, and is only to be learned there, and that by himſelf alone.</p>
               <p>And this is done to the <hi>truly humbled Soul:</hi> For ſuch only are to be conceived, as intended in the word, <hi>Them,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with an eye, and reference to that, which was mentioned in Verſe 24. <hi>To them that thou haſt given me.</hi> Theſe were Beleevers; but if ye look at them, as under that Name, and ſpecial reſpect, in which they muſt be conſidered, when they become as proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, unto which the knowledge of the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, comes to be manifeſted in the Order appointed by Chriſt: this is the moſt proper expreſſion, that can be made, and the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks moſt exactly to in this behalf. So <hi>John</hi> 17.6. I <hi>have manifeſted thy Name to them, that thou gaveſt me out of the World.</hi> This, as hath formerly been proved, cannot imply Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction properly: for that is meant in another Phraſe in the ſame Verſe: <hi>Thine they were,</hi> that is, by Election, <hi>and thou gaveſt them to me:</hi> This is an effect of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo diſtinct from it, elſe it would be a vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, which cannot fal upon the Spirit of God, nor may by us be once imagined. Thoſe who are given to Chriſt, are given him <hi>out of the World,</hi> ſo verſe 6. that is, out of the corrupt World.</p>
               <p>But it is not a Truth, nor Orthodoxal to affirm, that Election is out of the corrupt Maſs.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee then the Scope, and ful Purpoſe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine propounded, and ſo of the Place in hand.</p>
               <p>We ſhal hence proceed to the Explication, which we ſhal do by opening of three Things:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>What this Name is.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>What it is to make it known.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Why this is properly given to our Savior.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:66082:192"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is meant by the Name of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Name of God,</hi> in General ſignifies any thing, by which God comes to be known as a man is known by his Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. But here it muſt of neceſſity be reſtrained to a narrower ſenſe: But what that is, is hard to diſcover. We may thus gather in upon it, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Circumſtances in the Text.</p>
               <p>Look backward to that which follows: It's the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that Name, by which the Love, wherewith the Father Loved Chriſt, may be in them: and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Name of his Wrath, and Juſtice of a Judg, and an Avenger: But it muſt be the Name of his Mercy, and the Name of his Fatherly Mercy alſo. For unleſs it were the Name of a Father, How could he love them, as he loved Chriſt? for he loved him as a Father. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is ſuch Love as is extended to ſuch as have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him, as the Father, and firſt Perſon in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to ſuch as be miſerable, and diſtreſſed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be Fatherly Mercy, that is, he muſt be the Father of Mercy, as wel as of men, that muſt extend ſuch Love to ſuch undeſerving ones.</p>
               <p>Again, As ſuch, who are miſerable, and forlorn in themſelves, cannot have help, but through Mercy, and the Mercy of him, againſt whom they had finned: There muſt needs be a way how to intereſt them in this, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to this Mercy, which others, as miſerable as themſelves, do never ſhare in, nor ſhal be made partakers of: For what avails it, that there is Mercy, if I cannot come at it?</p>
               <p>And that which muſt convey this intereſt, can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on our parts by which we may deſerve it, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it, or once come to challenge it: It muſt come from God alone. As there is no mercy but in himſelf, ſo there is no way but by himſelf to intereſt any therein.</p>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:66082:193"/>
               <p>He being bound to none of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who had deſerved nothing but wrath at his hand, by reaſon of their ſinnes and provocations, If he had been pleaſed to have ſhut up the Bowels of his compaſſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his mercy to himſelf, that none ſhould ever have been able to make any claim thereunto, or have had any expectation thereof, he might have done it.</p>
               <p>But as he had Fatherly mercies in himſelf: though he was free and bound to none: He out of his Fatherly mercy, that he might give others an intereſt therein, he did freely ingage himſelf, and al his ſufficiencies, to procure and accompliſh the good and welfare of ſuch, as he ſhould pluck out of themſelves and the world, and put into the hands of Chriſt. And thus he becomes bound, and makes himſelf a debtor, to them, to whom nothing was due, both for the conveyance of al good to them, and continuance of al that good with them, that might be for their everlaſting comfort. And thus his love might not only be offered, but comes to be and abide in them. <hi>That the love, wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that its hence evident, that its the name of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mercy and Faithfulneſs, that is here to be underſtood, and the name that Chriſt would make known; the name of a Father, and a Father of mercies, who hath al good, and of faithfulneſs, who is ingaged to perform al that may be good and helpful to his ſervants.</p>
               <p>Look we forward a little, the foregoing circumſtance gives in the like evidence alſo. <hi>They know that the Father had ſent him,</hi> and the making known of this name makes them know it.</p>
               <p>This ſending argues, As his <hi>Authority,</hi> that <hi>be can,</hi> So his <hi>Fatherly affection,</hi> that he <hi>wil,</hi> uſe his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Order and communication of work, and his faithful word (which he hath ingaged) to ſend Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o this end. And he being ſent ſtands ingaged to anſwer the Order of the Father, and to act under the wil of him
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:66082:193"/>that ſends to the ful accompliſhment of this work, for the procuring of the welfare of the humbled Soul and then his love may be in them, and Chriſt in them alſo.</p>
               <p>We have now got ſhore and gained thus much, that we underſtand what this name is, which is to be made known.</p>
               <p>We ſhal open it in both the Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Name of the Father of mercies containes four things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That everlaſting compaſſions are firſtly and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently in him: he is the Father of them al: theſe yerning commiſerations come out of his own Bowels. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. Where are the ſounding of thy Bowels? We ſhould father compaſſion upon nothing we have, or do, or deſerve, but only upon God. No good we have, or can do, can cauſe theſe: no evil we can do (except the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt) can hinder theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a generation and ſucceſſion of mercies, which have been extended through al Ages, to al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, and that upon al occaſions: al which are of the ſame Houſe and pedegree, come from the ſame Father of mercies, are of the ſame line and lineage.</p>
               <p>Al the ſins of al his, which have been committed in all Ages and generations, with al the heightning Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thereof, could never leſſen, weaken, interrupt the courſe of theſe Fatherly compaſſions, much leſs exhauſt them, and draw them dry. The Pſalmiſt finds no end of them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.23, 24. For his mercy endureth for ever. Though temptations endure, which may annoy: yet his mercy ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>res for ever. And that which is eſpecially to be attended is, that he works as the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (who hath been wronged and provoked) and yet as a Father pities us..</p>
               <p n="3">3. There be renewed and unknown Commiſerations, which were never heard of before, yet may be expected, and wil certainly be provided for the good of thoſe, that
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:66082:194"/>he wil do good unto. He is the Father of mercies, he begets freſh and new compaſſions every day and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as never ſaw light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor happily ever entred into the apprehenſions of the ſons of men. Such things as wel looked mot for. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.3. This props up the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der overbearing preſſures. Thou ſaieſt, ordinary medicines wil cure ordinary and common diſeaſes; but thy rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions are not to be matched; no ſinner, no ſin, like thine.</p>
               <p>Be it ſo, either in truth, or in thy conceiving: yet here be unheard of compaſſions, if thine be unheard of provocations. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He hath ſent Chriſt on purpoſe to help thoſe that cannot help themſelves. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3. <hi>With thee the Fatherleſs finds mercy.</hi> With this Father of merc, es, the moſt helpleſs, Hopeleſs Orphane, &amp; Fatherleſs Soul may find relief. He was ſent on purpoſe not to cal the righteous; not the haughty and ſelf confident, who pride themſelves in their excellencies, conceive they can heal themſelves with their own balſom, and that their own abilities wil work their own welfare. No: but was ſent to cal the ſinner, the broken-hearted and ſelf-denying ſinner. And he is come on this Errand, and wil not fail of his end, or the effecting of that, for which he was ſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is yet another piece of this name of the Father, which is his <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> As he is the Father of mercy and of al good in himſelf. ſo he hath freely and fully ingaged himſelf to accompliſh the good and welfare of ſuch, as be truly humbled, and he hath given to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>He hath paſſed his Word, and ſignified his Wil, to ſee al good done for them, that can be deſired, as needful; al evil removed, which they can fear, as hurtful, and dangerous to their Souls: And in this the Pſalmiſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.4.10. <hi>In God will I praiſe his Word, &amp;c.</hi> In the Lord wil I praiſe his Word. For what had
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:66082:194"/>it availed, that God hath al mercy in himſelf, unleſs he had ingaged his word, to improve and imploy that for my benefit; I had had no ground to claime any thing, nor Hope to expect any thing at his hand. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2. Therefore herein God hath magnified his word above al other his Name: he hath laid al his excellencies and ſufficiency to pawn, and improved al, that the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an humbled ſinner ſhal not miſcarry.</p>
               <p>This is the ſweet that goes through all his names, and gives a pleaſing reliſh unto al: When his word is in his Power, it wil preſerve, not deſtroy &amp;c. As he ſent Chriſt for to ſave: ſo it is his wil, which he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and its the end which he intended, in furniſhing our Savior with al fulneſs of power. Joh. 17.2. Thou haft given him power over all fleſh, that he might give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. Now there is ſome ground for our hearts and Hopes to look unto, that this wil ſhal be accompliſhed, and this power improved. See how all the work of life proceeds on pleaſantly. They who were thus given, they ſhal come: that is, beleeve. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. When they come, then Chriſt keeps them. Joh. 17.12. <hi>Thoſe whom thou haſt given me I have kept and none of them is loſt</hi> Nay he prayes the Father would keep them alſo. Yea he wil not overly keep them himſelf, but he intreats the Father: <hi>Keep through thine won Name,</hi> that is, the Name of thy Fatherly mercies, for in thy word thoſe are alſo ingaged for their good. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. Nay not only kep't, but quickned, increaſed, perfected in all Grace and not left, til he ſee them Crowned in glory. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39.</p>
               <p>No wonder therefore that our Savior ſhould reſolve, ever to be making known this name of the Fathers mercy and Faithfulneſs, ſince it comprehends the beginning, continuance, end, and perfection of al we can have or Hope for, here or hereafter. Learn this, and learn all; Perfect this, and perfect al. All that Chriſt wil teach
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:66082:195"/>returnes to this: All that we can learn is Vertually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this: As a Father of mercies, he hath al, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets all good. Out of the Faithfulneſs of his word, he diſpenſeth all. Thus we ſee what the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther containes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How doth Chriſt make known this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This wil appear in a double work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord Chriſt ſpreads all thoſe glorious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies before the Eyes of the Soul, darts in the Beams of thoſe ſurpaſſing Beauties of mercies and compaſſions, and cauſeth all this glorious good to paſs before us, (as he ſpeaks to <hi>Moſes</hi>) which at the firſt dazels and draws the Eyes of the Soul towards them, to gaze at ſuch an amazing ſight. 2 Tim. 1.10. — <hi>Brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> Joh. 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up into theſe Heavenly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions but the Son of man,</hi> Who is in Heaven, he brings Heaven down to the Soul. Thoſe were, like dazeling Colors laid forth in the greateſt perfections, laid in a dark Room, not diſcerned: but the light came that acted them to the Eyes. The ſtrangeneſs of the ſight takes up the underſtanding, makes it ſtand won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and gazing. As <hi>Moſes</hi> did by the Buſh burning, he went neer to ſee that wondrous fight. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this is not al: He further ſets on thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies by the diſcovery of ſome unexpected ſuitableneſs to the Soul and the condition thereof, as appointed and performed with intendment to his good who is given to Chriſt: Gods wil hath determined, Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived al power for this very purpoſe to communicate them to him.</p>
               <p>Its poſſible for God to dart in ſome kind of raviſhing appearances of the excellencies of mercies, life, and Salvation, which paſs by, as ſudden lightning upon the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:66082:195"/>underſtanding. So it was with <hi>Balaam,</hi> who had a glimpſe of the glory of Heaven, and it ſtirred his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the while. <hi>Let me die the death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and let my laſt end he like his. Numb.</hi> 23.10. But it left nothing behind it, he is as far to ſeek as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As a man ſeeing his Face in a Glaſs, ſo theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what they were.</p>
               <p>But theſe leave ſome intimation of ſome kind of ſpecial proviſion appointed for the purpoſe. <hi>My Meſſage is to thee.</hi> Leaves ſome impreſſion of Wiſdom, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the way of Grace for our own future good: that he comes to a gueſs of the way of life and peace: though he hath no perfect skil, yet he can ſay, it coaſts within ſuch a compaſs, it lies to that point, though he cannot readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hit the Particular Path. As the poor Man ſaid after God had broken his heart; It ſeiſed upon me like Thunder and Lightning: from that day forwards I could diſcern ſomthing in every Sermon.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the meaning of that which torments Interpreters, and exerciſed mine own thoughts many a time, and its very difficult to cut the Hair, we wil ſpeak a word to it. 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Chriſt is made of God to us Wiſdom.</hi> We may come at it thus: 1. This Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom cannot be juſtification, not ſanctification, for thoſe are mentioned immediately after: and therefore they are not there meant. Therefore it muſt be in vocation.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Argument is taken from that relation he ſtands in unto the Father. The proper Nature of Relates is to manifeſt and give knowledge each of other. Math. 11.27. <hi>No man knowes the Father but the Son &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, but the only begotten Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Argument from the commiſſion delegated unto Chriſt. He it is, Whom the Father hath appointed to communicate his counſel to his faithful Ones. Hebr. 1.2. — <hi>He hath ſpoken in theſe laſt daies unto us by his Son.</hi> Joh. 16.15. <hi>All that the Father hath are mine, therefore ſaid I,</hi> He ſhal take of mine and ſhal ſhew it unto you. So that the Son hath al committed to him, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to the Holy Spirit who ſpeaks not of his own, but what he hath heard.</p>
               <p>Thus we have the explication of the point: And the work of our Savior what he hath done. We ſhal refer, for application, to what follows in the uſes hereafter made to the enſuing Doctrins.</p>
               <p>The Second and next thing in order, it the work of our Savior and his profeſſion and ingagment; What he wil do. I <hi>have declared thy Name;</hi> This he hath done: And he add's further, <hi>And</hi> I <hi>wil declare it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I enter upon that, we ſhal Obſerve by the way, the conjoyning and coupling of theſe two works of our Savior together; <hi>I have,</hi> and <hi>I wil:</hi> What he had done in former times, and what he would do for future.</p>

                  <p>It ſhews us whither to go for relief in our Spiritual
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:66082:199"/>Neceſſities: It's that which Nature ſuggeſts, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon perſwades unto: Al men wil be ſure to go thither, where they are ſure of ſpeed at al ſeaſons. That's only to the Lord Chriſt, who is a Faithful Savior, and a ſure Friend, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Caſt all your care on him, for he careth for you.</hi> When al men are altogether Vanity, feeble, and falſe, you know not where to have them; off, and on, weak as water, and uncertain as the wind; now they favor, anon they frown; love to day, and hate to morrow; they are but broken Reeds, not only fail us, but pierce us alſo.</p>
                  <p>But with our Savior, is no ſhadow of change, you may know where to have him, and what to expect from him. Men both prize, and uſe the Medicine that hath a <hi>probatum eſt</hi> with it: It wil not fail to cure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Diſease; the Salve that wil not fail to heal. It's ſo with the healing Mercy, and Faithfulneſs of Chriſt: So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>They that know thy Name, they will truſt in thee; for thou never faileſt them,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. Mens care and kindneſs, is ſoon drawn dry, and ſpent, that they count it's enough to deny for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe they have formerly done a Favor. What! ſay we, I have dealt ſo, done ſo formerly, ye do not expect I ſhould do ſo alwaies. But it's otherwiſe with our Savior; he hath comforted, and he wil quicken; he hath taught thee in thy aberrations, and he wil teach thee ſtil.</p>
                  <p>Nay, Thou art ſo giddy, and un-ſtable, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what to make of thy ſelf; ſo off, and on, feeble and falſe to thine own Soul, and thine own Comforts, and there is no hold of that unſteady, and giddy heart: now promiſing, and then altering; now reſolving, and then changing. If thou had'ſt truſted to thine own heart, thy Hope, and Comforts, and Confidence would have failed utterly.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord wil not ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail, notwithſtanding al thy provocations againſt him, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:66082:200"/>from him, unkind dealings with him. Though thou haſt failed, and forfeited al his Favors, yet he wil not ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail. As he was in former, ſo he is ſtil for future times, and wil he the ſame for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; he hath, and he wil, after the ſame manner, for ever comfort thee. Though thou beeſt Faithleſs to him, and thy own Soul, he wil be Faithful to his own Word, and to thy Comfort.</p>

He never laies aſide the care of your Comfort and welfare, never lay aſide the care of his Commands. O! miſerable would our lives be, if the Lord ſhould leave us at uncertainties. It's the dregs of the Vengeance, the higheſt pitch, and the perfection of the Plagues that God threatens, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.65. The Lord ſhal give thee a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and ſorrow of mind, and thy life ſhal hang in doubt before thee, and thou ſhalt fear day and night, and ſhalt have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thy Life; <hi>In the morning thou ſhalt ſay, Would to God it were night, &amp;c. for the fear of thy heart.</hi> If ſo for our temporal Lives and Comforts, what would it be, if our Eternal Happineſs, and Miſery of our Souls were at this paſs?

If he ſhould give us trembling of heart, failing of eyes, and ſorrow of mind, and we ſhould have no hold of Gods Favor or Aſſurance. I ſhal one day periſh, and look every day to have the Wrath of the Lord to come out againſt us, or elſe to leave us to our feebleneſs, and the malice of Satan, and that at laſt, God wil leave us utterly in the hands of Hel, how miſerable would this Condition be?</p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:66082:200"/>
                  <p>But God doth not, wil not deale thus with us: he comes to certainties with us; we may know there to have him. Yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever. Oh let us be the ſame for ever to the Lord Jeſus. He hath given us two immutable things, that we might have ſtrong conſolation: let God know where to find us, what to make of us. Fickleneſs and Inſtability is moſt loathſom to the Eye and diſtaſtful to the heart of the Almighty. <hi>I would thou wert either Hot or Cold.

As it was Gods wil to fend Chriſt: and Chriſts wil to accompliſh this. This is the wil of the Father that ſent me, that thoſe which he hath given me I ſhould looſe none. So let i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:66082:201"/>but this. So <hi>Barnabas</hi> perſwaded. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.23. To cleave to God with a decree of heart. Decree this, ſet it down, and determine this for a concluſion, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no exception or alteration. My God I muſt have, my god I wil have, his commands I have, and muſt and wil obey. Whether I ſhal have honor and credit: whether I ſhal pleaſe my ſelf, or carnal Reaſon or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt deſires, friends, or world, that I paſs not for I muſt pleaſe the Lord: That I ſet down for a decree.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let al make way to this, and work for this.</p>
                  <p>So Chriſt with us. Al things work together for our good. So make our Sorrows our miſeries, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, our peace, proſperity: whatever we have in the world beſides, make them al work together for this, to further our obedience. As the Marriner tacks about, uſeth Croſs winds, all, to further his voyage.</p>
                  <p>It was the Fathers wil, and Chriſts work, that he ſhould loſe none, and he did loſe none; he left Heaven, his Honor, his Life, nay the ſenſe of his Fathers Love: but he loſt not one of the pooreſt Saints: held them in his hand, God forſook him, he would not forſake them. Let the power of darkneſs pluck away eaſe, and peace, yea his life and al. <hi>My Soul it heavy unto the Death,</hi> Yet he would not ſuffer them notwithſtanding al their Malice, Wrath, Rage, Subtilty, to pluck one of his out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>So do thou. Loſe Credit, Comfort, Peace, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, yea thy Life; but loſe not one of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but obey it: not one Promiſe, but truſt in it: He hath kept thee at al times: Keep thou the word of his patience. Thou gaveſt them me, ſaith Chriſt, and I have kept them. So ſay thou; Thou gaveſt me theſe commands and I have obeyed them; theſe promiſes, and I have truſted in them. Not my wil, as Natural, ſaith Chriſt, to be preſerved, but thy wil, as God, that man may be redeemed: So ſay thou, not my wil, as
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:66082:201"/>Man, as Father, as Maſter, as Servant: not my wil which would have mine eaſe, and Profit, and Credit: But thy Wil be done.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be unmovable in the Work of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So our Savior, though he ſuffer the power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to pluck a way his Honor, his happineſs and Life: yet he held his Children in his Armes, and would not ſuffer any to take them out of his hand. So deal thou in like manner; Let Devils and Men pluck away thy Credit, and diſhonor thee, thy Wealth, and impoveriſh thee; yet let them not pluck away any one of Gods commands of Chriſts Promiſes from thee. Chriſt put a neceſſity upon it, I muſt bring theſe ſheep: lay thou the like neceſſity upon thy Soul. It is a rule of Chriſt, I muſt obey it, Chriſt I muſt love, and fear, and follow. Do not retire, ſtrike Sail, turn back, nay do not ſtop in the way, but go on: Its not neceſſary to live, but to love Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>We have done with this Point from the connection of the words. We ſhal now proceed to the other part of that work, which our Savior profeſſeth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth himſelf unto that he will further do, for time to come.</p>
                  <q>— <hi>I will make it known.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The profeſſion and reſolution of our Savior to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their further inlightening and inlargement in this knowledg, implies two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What the wants of the Saints are, as touching this knowledg.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What the care and ingagement of our Savior is to ſupply the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is here ſuppoſed, and that by neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. For had they attended the ful meaſure of this knowledg, that need hath our Savior to make known
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:66082:202"/>more? if they had been perfect in the skilful underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that lecture, what need was there that our Savior ſhould be dayly learning and informing them?</p>
                  <p>Its plain therefore, though they had much of this knowledg, there was yet much wanting unto them, of which they had, as dayly need, ſo dayly uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Hence we have two Points of Doctrin.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>There is much wanting in the ful knowledg of Gods Name in the moſt able Saints.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Chriſt lends dayly ſupply of knowledg to them, according to their dayly needs.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>To the Firſt.</hi> There is much wanting in the ful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Gods Name in the moſt able Saints.</head>
               <p>The moſt knowing Chriſtians, ſuch as may ſeem to be in the higheſt form, neer our Savior, taught and trained up under his Wing, yet have need, that more of the Name of the Father ſhould be made known to them. The Point is plain in the words, we ſhal need ſay no more to evidence it from the text; but addreſs our ſelves to the further explication of it. What this Name is, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Name of Gods Fatherly love and mercy and Faithfulneſs. And what it is to know it, or to have it made known, we have opened formerly, when the Lord Chriſt cauſeth al the good and incomparable excellency
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:66082:202"/>of this Fatherly mercy and Faithfulneſs to paſs before the Eye of the Soul, and ſets on that ſuitable ſweetneſs ſo effectually upon it, as that it affects and draws the heart to look that way by the Eye of Faith: ſo to Eye it, as to own it, and faſten upon it. This is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg here meant, and much of this is wanting, even in thoſe that are moſt eminent. Its a general ground which takes in the Particulars with advantage.</p>
               <p>When the holy man <hi>Job</hi> laid forth at large the waies of God in his Providence, limmed out to the life his excellencies, he ends with this, and vailes as it were, what he was not able to expreſs. Theſe are part of his waies, but how little a portion is heard of him. <hi>Job.</hi> 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>14. <hi>q. d.</hi> There is little of that unconceivable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency heard of, or reported, though the Earth and Heaven be ful of his goodneſs, and his mercy over al ſhines with the greateſt luſtre in al his works; yet this is but a little portion of him, and we know little of this. And hence <hi>Moſes,</hi> who converſed Face to Face with God, unto whom the Lord did familiariſe himſelf, as to a friend, yet he finds his neceſſity moſt here, and makes it his chief ſuit, if I have found Favor in thine Eyes, Lord ſhew me thy glory. If ever he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a mortal man, it might ſeem he did in an eſpecial manner expreſs himſelf to him. And therefore it was his preheminence above the Prophets to whom he would make known himſelf in a viſion and dream; <hi>My Servant</hi> Moſes <hi>is not ſo: to him</hi> I <hi>wil ſpeak Mouth to Mouth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently,</hi> Viſibly, familiarly, and openly. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10. And yet he begs this as the greateſt honor. <hi>Lord ſhew me thy glory.</hi> And Gods anſwer ſhews his Aim. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5, 6. I <hi>will cauſe my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſs before thee; ſtrong, gracious, merciful, aboundant in goodneſs and truth &amp;c.</hi> The greateſt part of that we know is the leaſt part of that we know not. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to come to ſupply that which is lacking in their Faith; and this is the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:66082:203"/>knowledg eſpecially Aimed at, wherein we ſhal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>In what this want appeares.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The Reaſon why there is left ſuch.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. This want appeares and is made good in four Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Much is wanting in regard of incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible and boundleſs greatneſs of this Fatherly mercy and Faithfulneſs, which cannot be comprehended by the beſt ability of the ſtrongeſt Faith or ſpiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Adepth that cannot be fathomed. A light unto which we cannot approach: only we are gathering in ſomthing nearer and groping ſomwhat more, as we attain to the ſtrength and growth of Faith. <hi>Job.</hi> 11.7. Canſt thou by ſearching find out the Almighty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? it is higher than Heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper than Hel, what canſt thou know? the meaſure thereof is larger than the Earth, and broaden than the Sea. Therefore the Pſalmiſt inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, he falls into admiration of this mercy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Oh how great is thy goodneſs, that thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, and laid out for them that truſt in thee, before the ſons of men!</hi> We are not able to value the goodneſs that is laid out in the waies of his providences and Fatherly diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. But the treaſuries of compaſſions that have been hoarded and laid up from al eternity, Oh how great! If the ſtock be ſo large that the Father puts into the hand of a Child when he is now in his non-age and ſetting up: what wil the whole eſtate and revenews be, when he come to his inheritance? therefore the Lord ſhewes the infinite diſproportion betwixt his thoughts of goodneſs towards his; and the narrowneſs of their conceivings to teach at the meaſure thereof. Iſa. 55. <hi>As high as the Heaven is above the Earth, ſo far are my thoughts above yours.</hi> A point or center that is leſs than any quantity, and the great Circumference
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:66082:203"/>that is the largeſt of al quantity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Much is wanting in regard of the clear diſcerning of that, which is ſome meaſure we do conceive; much of this Name yet conceived, we know not, and that which we do know, is dimly, and in a dark manner. Its a ſtrange Check of our Savior to <hi>Philip,</hi> upon his requeſt expreſſed, Joh. 14. <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſhal ſuffice us.</hi> Verſe, 8. Our Savior by a ſharp interrogation caſts a ſecret ſhame of feebleneſs and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes upon him. What? have I been ſo long with you, and yet doſt thou not know me <hi>Philip?</hi> he that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father alſo. And if ye do but caſt your Eye upon the 7. Verſe. Ye wil perceive that they did know the Father and had ſeen him. And yet <hi>Philip</hi> deſires, he might be ſhewed, as though they had never known nor ſcene. The iſſue from hence will be here, that its poſſible for a Chriſtian to ſee the Father, and in a ſenſe to converſe with him; and yet he needs to have him made known whom he knows, and to have him ſhewed, whom he ſees. So he is <hi>Job.</hi> The Lord paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by and we perceive him not, he ſpeaks once and twice and we hear him not. That as it was ſaid of the Diſciples <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.16. Their Eyes were held, that they did not know him: they did know diſcerningly whom they ſaw, and with whom they did familiarly converſe, and therefore its added. Verſe, 31. <hi>Their Eyes were opened and they knew him.</hi> So it is with the Eye of our underſtanding, in the right conceiving of the miſtery of this Fatherly mercy and Faithfulneſs of God; though we converſe familiarly with this goodneſs of the Lord, yet becauſe our apprehenſions are marvailous feeble and dim, they muſt be further cleared before we can know, and diſcerne that we do know. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. We ſee through a vail and therefore need to be helped to ſee what we ſee? to fee more fully what we ſee feebly and imperfectly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Much is wanting in regard of the experience of this
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:66082:204"/>Fatherly Faithfulneſs which as yet they never found, or having formerly found it, they are now deprived of it.</p>
               <p>Some as yet have never found it. For the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth his favors in the fitteſt ſeaſon, and ſo as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have moſt need, and may make moſt improvement of. So Gen. 22.14. <hi>In the mount of the Lord it ſhal be ſeen.</hi> And Rom. 5.4. <hi>Patience worketh experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Hope maketh not aſhamed becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts.</hi> Verſe, 5. God ſteps in ſeaſonably, and gives proof of his Fatherly Care. Herb. 4.16. <hi>We find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> As the Father reſerves a ſpecial favor for his Child to a ſeaſon, a morſel, a bit to give him at a turn.</p>
               <p>Some have formerly found it by experience, but are now deprived of it. Hence is that of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 63.2. <hi>To ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> So again <hi>Quicken me as thou art wont. Pſal.</hi> 89.49. Where are thoſe former loving kindneſſes? The lower the Eo the greater the flow. God withdrawes the expreſſions of his Favor, that they may be made more fit and have them more aboundantly. <hi>For a little while I have hid my Face, but with everlaſting kindneſs wil I have Mercy on thee. Iſa.</hi> 54.8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Much is wanting, in regard of that ful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, which they were promiſed, and do deſire, but yet could never attain unto.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Heman Pſa.</hi> 88.14, 15. <hi>Lord why caſteſt thou off my Soul? why hideſt thou thy Face from me?</hi> I <hi>am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while</hi> I <hi>ſuffer thy terrors I am diſtracted. Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy Terrors have Cut me off. They came round about me dayly like Water: they compaſſed me about together.</hi> Verſe, 16, 17. So <hi>David, Mine Eyes fail for looking for thy Salvation: Ob when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> Pſal. 119.82.</p>
               <pb n="481" facs="tcp:66082:204"/>
               <p>Much then is wanting, in regard of what may be known; in regard of the cleer diſcovery of what we do know; in regard of the Experience we have had, and want; in regard of the Aſſurance we ſeek, and do not attain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Reaſons hereof are two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Is taken from the Condition of the Saints, while they are in this vale of Tears: They are as Babes in the Womb, or at the beſt, as Children born; but in their non-age, and tender yeers: and therefore in rational proceedings, their abilities and performances muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome reſemblance and proportion: they muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Child-like weakneſſes, and imperfections. So the Apoſtle diſputes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>When</hi> I <hi>was a Child, I ſpake as a Child, I underſtood as a Child, I thought as a Child.</hi> Their Speech is not ful, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is feeble, their thoughts are under and low, looking at poor and mean things, ſuch as be moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and liable to the Sences: things of depth and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as they cannot conceive them, ſo they do not for the moſt part attend them, becauſe they are beyond their reach.</p>
               <p>So it is with our Spiritual Child-hood. The things of God and Grace, which are moſt eaſie, and openly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, we are moſt exerciſed, and taken up withal; but the great Myſteries of Godlineſs, the unſearchable Riches of Mercy, and the deep things of God, we are not able upon the ſudden to ſearch into. Our Savior gives this Reaſon to his Diſciples; <hi>I have many things to ſay, but ye cannot yet receive them.</hi> A Child that is in the lower Form, happily entring into his Latin, he is not able to carry away his Lecture of Greek, not to touch difficult things of Phyloſophy; but his Principles and Abilities muſt have time to ripen, before he be ſet up into ſo high a Form. So here.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. When they are under preſſures, and neceſſities, and miſeries march in upon them, the Lord ſeems, like an angry Father, to withdraw himſelf.

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:66082:205"/>ſhe ſhould not have compoſſion on the Son of her Womb?</hi> theſe may, yet I wil not. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.8. <hi>Who is like to thee,</hi> or to thy Faithfulneſs round about thee? it's round about him, <hi>per omnes circuitus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I have dealt careleſly, yea, unkindly, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly with him, and grieved the eyes of his Glory by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provocations. True, thou haſt firſt broken with him, and thou mayeſt ſee, and know thy falſnels; but thou doſt not know his Faithfulneſs, and Fartherly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.33. <hi>Nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs, I will not take away from him, nor ſuffer my Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fail.</hi> Though he may deſerve it, and I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it; yet I wil not ſuffer, &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2. They conceive their Sins ſo many, and ſo hainous, that it's beyond the compaſs, and bounds of his Fatherly Compaſſions to remit, and pardon. Thou doſt not know what theſe Bowels of a Father are, and therefore thou doſt not judg aright, what he can, and wil do. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaned his ſin, God yerneth tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards him, and bemoaneth him; though he doth not hear God, yet God hears him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>I have heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf thus; Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed.</hi>

                  <p>See how gods Bowels turn within him, verſe 19. <hi>My Bowels are turned within me; I wil ſurely have mercy upon him.</hi> Mercy is mourning over thy Soul, when thou art mourning for thy ſin. True, could I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; but I have been ſmitten, and yet walked after the way wardneſs of my heart; ſo that I dare not look upon my ſin; and I cannot look to Heaven, becauſe of my guilt: I know not how I can be pardoned.</p>

True, I have found him ſomtimes in deſperate ſtreights relieving me, when I was linking, and paſt hope, my head under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: when al his billows were running over, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, and ſupporting me.</p>
                  <p>This is but a Lightening before my Death, he wil leave me at laſt: it's but a Reprieval before ſome more heavy Plague and Condemnation.

               <p n="1">1. Al depends upon this; I mean, upon the Name of his Fatherly Love, and Faithfulneſs. I ſpeak of it now, as it iſſues peculiarly from the ſpecial manner of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſubſiſtence, and work. For therein the out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Deity are firſtly diſcerned, and laſtly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Eſpecially this is to be attended, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was directly offended by the ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore it muſt come firſtly in order from him, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and to accept a Surety for the Conveyance of Grace and Mercy. And herein lies the out-going of the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:66082:208"/>God-head firſt; I look at the manner of his working. The Father works of himſelf, the Son from the Father, the Holy Ghoſt from both. So that had not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moved, or put forth this work, the Son would not, the Holy Spirit would not, becauſe they work in order from the Father, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. and 12. and laſt verſe. So <hi>John</hi> 16.13. Chriſt ſpeaks what he hears from the Father, the Spirit what he hears from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Al is contained in this, and from this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Saints. Hence the Covenant of Grace, which is here firſt attended, The Promiſe of God in Chriſt before the World was, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. This was in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. God fed the Patriarchs with this, nothing but the dayly repetition, and conſideration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, therefore bleſſing goes with it, is diſcovered by it: <hi>I will bleſs thee. In thee ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> He hath ſworn that he wil bleſs us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72, 73. that is, he wil be a God in Covenant.</p>
               <p>This is the Cauſe why God ſo appears: <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>the God of</hi> Jacob. And this is the Ground of our Reſurrection. God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. God remembers his Covenant with us, and for us.</p>
               <p>Collections hence, are many.</p>
               <p>This Truth, this Tree is loaded with abundance of Fruit: We wil ſhake it a little, and ſee what is moſt ripe, and moſt readily offers it ſelf to our Obſervation, for our benefit; that each man may gather, and take that which may be moſt for his own Help, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>

               <p>Hence it's cleer, The beſt of the Saints, men of choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Graces, and beſt Abilities, as touching the right Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the myſterious Deeps of Gods Fatherly Mercy, the live meerly upon a dayly dependance, while they have a day to live in this World, The Leſſon is ſo hard and difficult, that our Savior is dayly ſpelling and repeating, alwaies teaching, and yet there is more to be taught; more knots to be untied, ſecrets to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As to <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> John 1.50. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than theſe.</hi> And therefore <hi>David,</hi> when he was a Scholler of the higheſt Form, he craves the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help of Chriſt, becauſe the work was too hard, <hi>Teach me the way to thee, thy Spirit is good,</hi> Pſal. 143.8, 10. <hi>Open mine Eyes, that I may ſee the wonders of thy Law.</hi> There were yet more wonders to be ſeen, though he had ſeen wonders al his daies. This Name is <hi>Wonderful,</hi> as the Angel to <hi>Manoah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide, The Leſſon is marvelous large, we had need be dayly learning, and yet we ſhal never come to the end of it, before we come to the end of our daies. As men who travel in the main Ocean; they ſee nothing but Water, and yet ſee neither Side nor Shore, Brim nor Bottom, and there is more Water to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>The ſaving Knowledg of this Name of Gods Fatherly Mercy, when it fils the mind, as the Waters cover the Sea. <hi>Habb.</hi> 2.14. we may ſail here in dayly ſearch, and when we know, yet there is ſomthing ſtil beyond our knowledg, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That we know the Love of Chriſt, that paſſeth knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Name of Gods Fatherly Mercy, is like that Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.1, 2. So many Leaves, and ſo thick written, that we cannot turn over the Pages; much leſs able to come to the ful knowing, and conceiving of it. So it is here.</p>
               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:66082:209"/>
               <p>The Name of Gods Mercy and Faithfulneſs, its writ ſo thick in al the waies and works of God, in al the ordinances, Nay in al the diſpenſations of God and his operations, from election to our glorification, affords ſo many ful vollums, and ſo many freſh editions. That we are ſtil new to ſeek, unleſs the Lord Chriſt be pleaſed further to make known theſe unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the thing to be known is darke and difficult: So we are ſhallow in our apprehenſions.</hi> As our Savior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his own, brought up under his own Wing. Luk. 24.25. <hi>O Fools and ſlow of Heart to know theſe depth's of Gods Grace and Mercy.</hi> Our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, like narrow mounh'd Veſſels, can take in little and that in a long time, though never ſo much be diſcovered and laid before us. And Therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior is conſtrained to deal with us, as Maſters with their Schollers which are dul and heavy of apprehenſion, ever pointing at the word, and putting the Feſcue to the Letter: Line upon Line, and precept after precept, here a little, and there a little, as the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.10. So it is with ſuch Babe-like feeble ones as we be, though we have Daily help, yet we have daily need of new help to be continued to us. As little ones, they muſt be taken up, dreſſed, and tended daily, becauſe they are helpleſs in themſelves.</p>
               <p>But that which is the maine of al. <hi>The very Terms of the Covenant, and the Office of our Savior, and the condition of the State of Grace calls for this.</hi> For al the Treaſures of Wiſdom and knowledg are hid in Chriſt, and he keeps the Keyes in his own hand and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and gives out our pittance and allowance what he ſees fit. We need our dayly direction and inſtruction in the things of Grace and eternal life, more than our dayly Bread.</p>
               <p>The Body needs the conſtant direction of the Eye and adviſe of the head, for every thing it doth, and that every moment. Its thus in the natural, its the ſame in the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:66082:209"/>ſpiritual and miſtical Body: So the Apoſtle 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>Of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, we are not ſufficient to think a good thought, but our ſufficiency is of God. Without me ye can do nothing. Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. He hath taught you in the morning, he muſt teach you at Noone, and at Night alſo. He hath cleared up our doubts, he muſt help us in the next again, or els we ſhal be to ſeek as much as ever. He muſt Water us every moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> hath the ſtaff and ſtock in his own hand, and he loſt al, and himſelf and his too. Therefore now the Lord Jeſus keeps the ſtock in his own care, in his own hand, gives us ſuch allowance, as he ſees fit, ſuitable for our good.</p>
               <p>As Fathers, when they ſee their Sons to laviſh out their Patrimony, and grow licencious; they keep the revenewes and ſtate in their own hands, only allow them ſome yearly penſion or annuity for their relief. So here our Savior makes us live, not of our yearly, but our daily, yea hourly annuities.</p>
               <p>That Grace that helped thee the laſt month, the laſt week, the laſt day, the laſt morning, how to ſee God, how to cloſe with him, and depend upon him, and gain aſſurance from him, wil not ſerve thee for the next occaſion happily. Either the work is more difficult, the way more dark, thine own indiſpoſition makes thee more unfit, thy temptations do more oppoſe, thy corruptions grow more active and violent, or thy unskilfulneſs, forgetfulneſs bring thee to a loſs, that thou ſhalt not be able to ſee the way. So that as Chriſt hath made known, ſo he muſt make known for the preſent, and ſo for the future.</p>
               <p>The beggar when he hath got his almes one day, he lives of that and ſpends it, and he muſt have a new almes, as a new day, he is as freſh to ſeek, and as free to beg, as ever. Chriſt is Gods Almner and we are his beggars. So <hi>Paul, He hath delivered, doth deliver, wil deliver.</hi>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:66082:210"/>Hath made known, doth make known, wil make known. As the Moon, every new Month, nay every hour, and minute muſt receive new light from the Sun. So here, Pſal. 36.9. <hi>In thy light we ſhal ſee light.</hi>

               <p>Its eaſie with Chriſt to darken the evidence of Gods love and mercy to the Soul, and to cloud al our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg we have, even in the cleareſt day: to put us to a loſs, that we may be to ſeek for our aſſurance and knowledg of Gods Fatherly goodneſs, when we think we are moſt ſure of it.</p>
               <p>Though he hath made known the name of the Father formerly, unleſs he ſtil make it known for future, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſtil renew the knowledg we have, we ſhal not be able to know what he have known. So <hi>Elihu</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>Job</hi> 34.29. When he giveth quietneſs, who then can cauſe trouble? and when he hideth his Face, who then can behold him? whether it be done againſt a nation or againſt a man only. <hi>q. d.</hi> Its not for want of skil that men do not compaſs this knowledg for their numbers or abilities never ſo many, even a whole nation God can darken them al. And therefore its ſaid, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.3. <hi>When the Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>came</hi> to try <hi>Solomon</hi> with ſome queſtions, he told her al, nothing was hid. So that God can hide even the glimmering Starr-light of the knowledg of Human things from men: Much more eaſie is it to conceive, how this may be done in theſe high, Heavenly, hidden myſteries; when its hard to know them, when they are made known to us. How impoſſible, if the Lord wil with-hold them from us? al our dexterity and Wiſdom wil do nothing, if Chriſt wil not direct. Therefore the Church complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Lam. 3.44. <hi>That God had covered himſelf with a cloud, that their Prayers could not come at him.</hi> When God ſent darkneſs into <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was not al the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:66082:210"/>Fires and Candles that could give any light, but they ſate three daies and three nights and ſtirred not out of their places. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.23. If the Sun of Righteouſneſs wil with-hold or withdraw his beams it wil be dark night with us in our doubtings and diſmayings, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, al the Learning, yea, the experiences alſo we have had. Yea Mercy and Grace may be preſent with us, and yet not be perceived. <hi>Philip</hi> ſaw the Father, and yet knew not what he ſaw.</p>
               <p>Beware here of three things, which the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the main Cauſe why.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Take heed of Carnal Confidence and truſting too much to Earthly Contentments.</hi> Pſal. 30.6.7. <hi>I ſaid in my proſperity</hi> I <hi>ſhal never be moved,</hi> Lord by thy favor, thou haſt made my mountain to ſtand ſtrong: <hi>Thou did'ſt hide thy Face, and</hi> I <hi>was troubled.</hi> When we turne our Eyes and hearts to the world, God turns away his gracious reſpect he expreſſed towards us. He wil make his preſence welcome, or he wil withdraw. Math. 23.38. <hi>Ye ſhal ſee me no more, til ye ſhal ſay, bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi> And therefore our Savior ſettles himſelf in this, Math. 11.25. I <hi>thank thee O Father, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Beware of Reſiſtance of the Truth, when it is made known.</hi> If ye wil not have his word to direct you, ye ſhal not have the knowledg of his Mercy, that may ſupport and refreſh you. When the ſpirit of truth comes to lead us into al truth, then it ſhal take of Chriſts and ſhew to us. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. I have given them thy word, and they have <hi>Received</hi> it, and they have known that thou haſt ſent me. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving wil let in this knowing. Revel. 3.20. <hi>If any wil open</hi> — I <hi>will come and Sup with him.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.24. <hi>If the word that ye have heard abide in you, ye

                  <item>3. <hi>Take heed of Sleighting</hi> and making little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of the <hi>Commandements of the Lord;</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to neglect the leaſt, or tamper with any ſinful diſtemper, or give way to infirmities or paſſions. So <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.8. <hi>He that truſteth in Lying vanities for ſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own Mercy.</hi> That is the mind of the context. Joh. 14.23. <hi>If any man love me, be wil keep my words and my Father wil love him, and we wil come unto him and make our abode with him.</hi> And Verſe, 21. I <hi>will manifeſt my ſelf to him;</hi> that is, keep him in his purity, keep him in his power as we keep liquors, that they looſe none of their life; they drink lively, and quick, as when new put up.</item>

               <p>The Faithful ſhould increaſe in the knowledg and right apprehenſion of this Name of Gods Fatherly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and it is their own fault, if they do it not, for els they might. For where can there be any cauſe of none Proficiency found, but in our ſelves? Chriſt hath undertaken the work, and who more able than he, who is the Wiſdom of the Father, and came out of his Boſom? and therefore is able to make known thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſecrets of Gods Fatherly Love, which never did ſee Sun, and reveal them.</p>

               <p>Yea you that are faithful, you have experience of his ſufficiency this way: you have a pawn in your hand, a real proof of what he hath done, when you were at the worſt, not only unskilful, but uncapable of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p>Yea he hath made you know the things belonging to

               <p>And he is the ſame that ever he was, and profeſſeth he wil make it known, there is no fault, nor want in Chriſt. But you are wanting to him, and your ſelves and play the Trevants in this; are laze and heedleſs to learn that which is ſo carefully, ſo conſtantly taught you.</p>

                     <item>2. <hi>How that Love is ſaid to be in them;</hi> that is, the Faithful.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>The Means, and Order know this is done.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To the Firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Love is that, which in an eſpecial manner, is appropriated unto our Savior: It's a peculiar Legacy, and Inheritance which appertains to him as a Son. And therefore look at it, as we muſt do in this place, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated in the ſpecial Reſpects and Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as proceeding from the Father as the Father, and terminated, and bounded upon him, as a Son: It's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarized, and impropriated to him, and to him alone. That however it may be ſaid, and that truly, in a true ſenſe, of al the glorious Perſons in the bleſſed Trinity,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:66082:215"/>that they love each other: yet this Love, as it is dyed in the heart of the Father, hath as it were the Tincture of that Relation, out of which, in an eſpecial manner, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, and is reſolved, and reſts in, and upon the Son. So it is given to him, and in that reſpect; and is of the like Nature with ſome other Acts, which are ſo attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As the Father ſends the Son, the Son is ſent only by the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Love is founded firſtly in that Eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereby the Son was begotten of the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al Worlds. For therein is the root of thoſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Properties, and ſo that Perſonal diſtinction, that appears betwixt the Father and the Son, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of al thoſe proper reſpects that appertain to each, and be attributed to them in a diſtinct manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence there ariſeth a ſpecial knowledg betwixt the Father and the Son, which anſwers the Specialty of their Relation. For that is a Conſequent which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from things that undergo relative Reſpects, they give ſpecial intimation each of other, becauſe they give relative being each to other: And therefore our Savior when he checked <hi>Philip</hi> for his ignorance, becauſe he knew not the Father; <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and knoweſt thou not me? he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father,</hi> John, 14.9. Relatives give Being each to other, and therefore give Knowledg each of other, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; and no man knows the Father, but the Son.</hi> As we ſee it in the Senſitive Creatures, ſo in al Generations, there is an eſpecial owning each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as the yong owns the Dam, the Dam the yong, by ſmel or bleating. He that hath his mind rectified by a Truth, he wil own that Truth that did rectifie him. The Son is the ſhine of the Fathers Wiſdom, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. A Light ſprung from a Light, <hi>John</hi> 10.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Father begets his Son; he owns him when he is begotten, the ſhine, and engraven Form of his own perſonal Excellency.</p>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:66082:215"/>
               <p>Laſtly: He loves whom he thus owns: The heart of the Father is wholly taken up with him, his thoughts wholly ſet upon him, his Soul is wholly ſatisfied in him; an Infinite, and Eternal Favorite, of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and Eternal Father; ſo that he cannot look off him, raviſhed with his beauties, and with an infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Soul-pleaſing ſatisfaction, takes contentment in him.</p>
               <p>This Love, look we at the next effects of it, diſcovers it ſelf in theſe two things, which are to be attended in this place.</p>
               <p>In

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Love laies out it ſelf in theſe two eſpecially, wherein the heart-blood, and vital Spirits of Love, expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The neerneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore our Savior preſſeth this with ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and holds the thoughts of <hi>Philip</hi> upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: <hi>Beleeveſt thou not, that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father?</hi> q. d. It's ſtrange thou ſhould'ſt fal ſhort of this: and therefore, verſe 11. he ſets home this Truth, as the main Corner Stone of a Chriſtians Comfort. <hi>[Beleeve me]</hi> I am aſſured of what I ſpeak, and it concerns thee deeply to receive what I ſay, as the loweſt Foundation of thy Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or elſe beleeve me for the very Works ſake]</hi> Theſe Works would never have been done, could never be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor your Comfort maintained therein, unleſs this In-being (taken together with the manner of it) as Son and Father, be proper to them. And therefore it is that the Father is ſaid to <hi>dwell in the Son,</hi> a Phraſe not attributed to the Holy Spirit in the Senſe and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Apprehenſion; nay, they are ſaid to be one, viz.
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:66082:216"/>in point of this Relative Union, <hi>John</hi> 10.30. For having ſaid, verſe 28. <hi>None ſhall pluck his Sheep out of his hand;</hi> he adds, <hi>Becauſe the Father, who gave them him, is greater than all, and he, and his Father are one;</hi> and therefore if they cannot pluck them out of his Fathers hand, they cannot out of his. Nay, this is made the ground of the great accompliſhment of al the great works he did, <hi>John</hi> 10.37, 38. <hi>If I do not the works of the Father, beleeve me not: But if I do, though ye beleeve not me, beleeve the Works; that ye may know, and beleeve that the Father is in me, and</hi> I <hi>in him.</hi> And therefore they are alwaies conjoyned in the Work by our Savior: <hi>My Father worketh hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and</hi> I <hi>work,</hi> John 5.17. therefore he is ſaid to come out of his boſom, and to lie in the Boſom of his Love. And this is true in regard of Chriſt, God-man, in regard of that Hypoſtatical Union, the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath with the Second Perſon, and ſubſiſtence it hath in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The intimateneſs of Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Love layeth open it ſelf in moſt inward, and intimate Communion of the Father and Son, each with other; as we have formerly obſerved from <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. I <hi>was with him, &amp;c.</hi> and was his delight, a word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two, to <hi>behold,</hi> and to <hi>retain.</hi> So to eye, and gaze upon another with raviſhment, and ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly to apply our ſelves to that other, as to hold, and keep him with us for ever. They have mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in al their Operations. The Son works nothing but what he ſees the Father work: Speaks nothing, but what he hears the Father ſpeak: doth nothing, but what the Fathers Wil is.</p>
               <p>They mutually glorifie one another, and that is their aim in al they do, <hi>John</hi> 17.1. <hi>Father, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son may glorifie thee,</hi> ver. 4, 5. I <hi>have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:66082:216"/>thee on Earth; glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the Glory which</hi> I <hi>had with thee, before the World was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath then the Soveraign Diſpenſation of al Works from the Father, who had his Being from him, and ſo his working.</p>
               <p>In the daies of his Humiliation, he laid aſide the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Power, and ſuffered the Power of darkneſs to prevail: but now he deſires al might be reſtored to him, verſe 5. Al theſe belong to Chriſt; God-man, in regard of the Union of our Nature with his Perſon.</p>
               <p>And this is the Love that is here intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Love of the higheſt ſtrain and pitch, of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and choyceſt Excellency, is here intended, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: This is the Standard to al the reſt. But the Love of God to Chriſt, is the cauſe of other the Bleſſings and Benefits that are beſtowed, <hi>John</hi> 3.35. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands.</hi> Therefore this Love, is a peerleſs, and unmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable Love: al other things, which are given to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, Grace, Glory, al Power in Heaven and Earth, are but the effects of it.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. The glory that our Savior hath given him of the Father, it is ſaid to Iſſue from a higher fountain, and to be but a ſtream of it, Namely, <hi>The Father loved him from the foundation of the World.</hi> Love is from Eternity: the fruits are in time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly: The whol Tenor of the Prayer and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Savior in this Chapter gives further evidence and argument to confirm it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How is this Love ſaid to be in them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this love of God in Chriſt ſets God on work to wil a like or proportionable good to the Creature. I would ſay thus.</p>
               <p>When God wils to have a Creature neer to him, in his
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:66082:217"/>Son, as his Son, to communicate intimately with the Creature through his Chriſt, as his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Then this love leaves a being like it ſelf upon the Creature: Its then in its vertue and efficacy in the fatithful.</p>
               <p>It was with God, put forth upon Chriſt, before the World was, and therefore much more before they were.</p>
               <p>But our Saviors Prayer is, that this love, which was expreſſed upon him, might alſo be extended unto his, made effectual and operative in his.</p>
               <p>Its true, the expreſſions of common love, and the communication of ordinary good, is of larger extent and iſſues from God, as the Creator of al, and he that is the firſt being and ſo gives being to al Creatures.</p>
               <p>But ſpecial union to be ſo high unto God, and to communicate ſo intimately with him, its firſtly here to be ſeen, and from hence therefore muſt be derived to all ſuch, who ſhal be ſo Priviledged, as to be made partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Means and Order how this is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The means by which God doth convey the efficacy of this love, wherewith he loved his Son, unto his Saints, may be thus conceived; As the eternal gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of the Son from the Father was the foundation of his love of the Father to the Son, as we have ſhewed, he begat him, knew, and owned and loved him: So the vertue of this eternal generation is the Cauſe, whence this love comes to have a being in the Saints. For out of this eternal generation it is, that God ſends his Son The Son being ſent, acts under that Authoritative Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and doth anſwer the purpoſe of the Father. And as Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and as Son, and as begotten of the Father, he aſſumes ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Nature into perſonal union with himſelf, becomes Head of the Covenant, and as he was
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:66082:217"/>begotten of the Father, ſo he begets Children unto God the Father. Therefore he is called the eternal Father: and the Father is ſaid to beget Children, becauſe Chriſt doth, as ſent by God the Father. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. The Father begets us through his reſurrection. Joh. 13. <hi>Born of God.</hi> And thence they have the Spirit of Sons. So in the text. <hi>The love wherewith thou haſt loved them, may be in them.</hi> But how is that? <hi>And I in them.</hi> That our Savior adds, to intimate how this comes about</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>When is this done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the love of God in Chriſt ſet Gods love, or ſet God on work, to ſend Chriſt begotten of him, to beget Children to him. And then this love through Chriſt, leaves like impreſſion and operations upon the Soul.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Brings the Soul into neereſt union with God through Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>2. Moſt intimately communicates of the ſpecial operations of the Spirit of the Father through Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Brings the finner into neereſt union, to wit, Chriſt is in the Soul Rom. 8.10 <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the Body is dead &amp;c. Yea dwelt in the heart. Eph.</hi> 3.17. And God by and through Chriſt. Rom. 8.9. So Joh. 17.23. <hi>I in them and thou in me.</hi> So 1 Joh. 2.24. <hi>Ye ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. The Church which is in God the Father and in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Leaves like operations, the moſt intimate and ſpecial communion of the Spirit of Chriſt and the Soul. So that God doth al through Chriſt by man, he doth nothing of, nor from himſelf. Thus Chriſt is al in al, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.</p>
               <p>And the ſinner is wholly now beyond the covenant of
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:66082:218"/>works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and with him in <hi>Adam.</hi> So that as <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, <hi>I live not, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> Gal. 2.20. I <hi>work, not</hi> I <hi>but the Grace of God with me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>And Chriſt in me.</hi> Coloſſ. 1. and laſt Verſe.</p>
               <p>When the love of God in Chriſt ſets God on work to ſend his Son begotten of him, to beget Sons unto him, ſo that he brings them to the neereſt union: God in Chriſt, and Chriſt, he one in them. They in Chriſt, and through Chriſt in God the Father: So that the Father in Chriſt doth al by them, they nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, receives alſo al from them, they take nothing to themſelves. Then this love of Chriſt is in them, and leaves a like efficacious impreſſion upon them.</p>
               <p>Hence a double Collection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may hence learn, how to come to a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods ſpecial love, and ſo to a right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and underſtanding of ſeveral Scriptures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>Gods ſpecial love is, when he purpoſeth to make the Creature neer to him in his Son, as his Son is neer. The Father is in his Son, Chriſt in the Faithful, and the Father by Chriſt in them. Chriſt is in the Father, the Faithful in Chriſt, and by him in the Father. He doth intimately communicate with them through his Chriſt, as with his Chriſt. God by Chriſt, doth al by them, they not of themſelves. He through Chriſt receives al from them, they take nothing to themſelves.</p>
               <p>This Love is like the main Hinge, upon which the whol Frame of Gods Diſpenſations turn, and many Scriptures ſeem to be made familiar, and ſomwhat open hereby. As this: Becauſe I wil make a Creature to me, in my Son, as my Son; therefore I wil Elect him, to ſet out this Love: And therefore create, and give Grace; and becauſe his own Grace cannot bring him ſo neer, as my Son, he ſhal through his default fal, and then I wil ſend my Son, and he ſhal take Humane Nature into
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:66082:218"/>Perſonal Union with him: In that to purchaſe al Grace, and have right to communicate al Grace, and in his time to bring them to God, and implant them in himſelf, and beſtow al Grace and Glory upon them: That when they have Grace and Glory upon them, they may acknowledg whence they had it: Cling about that God, and in Chriſt, that gave it: admire his Love to them; and cleave wholly in Love to his Son, whence he came to love them.</p>
               <p>Hence thoſe places receive Explication: <hi>Whom he knew, he elected.</hi> it's ſuch a knowledg that brings in Election; and therefore not common to Reprobation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. Therefore it's a knowledg with Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſuch as would own, and take neer to himſelf. So <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God who is rich in Mercy, according to his great Love, &amp;c.</hi> God who is rich in his pitying, and compaſſionating Mercy, according to his great Love, whereby he would take us to himſelf, make us next Neighbor to his Chriſt, and neer as his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore God expreſſed his pity and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards us, in recovering of us out of our diſtreſs: <hi>God ſo loved the World, &amp;c.</hi> John 3.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The tranſcendent Happineſs, which the Faithful attain, through the Covenant of Grace, above that of <hi>Adam.</hi> A man covenanted for men, and might have purchaſed happineſs for them, and communicated that to them by Natural Generation. But here, man loſt, can of himſelf, do nothing for himſelf: but God, and the power of a God, doth al that for us, which we cannot do for our ſelves. This is the Nature of our Glory.</p>
               <p>But God in Chriſt, wil be ſo neer to us, as to be in us; and give al, that we may be ſo neer to him, as to be in the Son, and the Father, and ſo return al. This is the Diamond in the Crown.</p>
               <p>But that the Love of the Father to his Son, ſhould ſet his Love on work to bring us to the like Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: This is the beauty, and brightneſs of the top of the Diamond of the Crown of Glory.</p>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:66082:219"/>
               <p>The Words thus opened, and explicated; we have hence theſe three Points of Doctrine:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>It is the Deſire, and Endeavor of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, That the deareſt of Gods Love, which was beſtowed on himſelf, ſhould alſo be given to his Faithful Servants.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Our Union, and Communion with God in Chriſt, is the top of our Happineſs in Heaven.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Our Saviors manifeſtation of the Name of the Father, is the means, and his ſcope, to bring in the Being of this Love of God unto us.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>This laſt ariſeth from the Coherence of theſe Words with thoſe which went before; and we do but name it, and refer the Reader to what we have formerly at large laid down touching the ſame, where we have declared both what the Name of the Father is, what is the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it, and what our Saviors Work is therein; and how, and why, he hath, and doth manifeſt it.</p>
               <p>The Two former we ſhal ſpeak ſomthing unto, whereof the firſt, with which we ſhal begin, was thus laid down:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:66082:219"/>
               <head>It is the Deſire, and Endeavor of our Savior,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> That the deareſt of Gods Love, which was beſtowed on himſelf, ſhould alſo be given to his Faithful Servants.</head>
               <p>You ſee how our Savior is not content to put them off with the leaſt pittance, the meaneſt proviſion, but he would have them have the beſt, the choyceſt rarities: If there were any Dainties better than other, he would carve out them to his People; as the Love wherewith thou haſt loved me.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was the only begotten, the Firſt-born of God, and had the Firſt-born Affections of God beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: and he is not ſatisfied, unleſs that Firſt-born Affection of the Father be imparted to them in their proportion.</p>
               <p>If there be one bit better than another, ſome ſpecial Rarity that comes unexpected, and that from far; it's the faſhion of tender-hearted Friends, I would this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving were but in ſuch a ones hand, though it coſt me more than I would ſpeak: it's the choyceſt Proviſion that ever I taſted.</p>
               <p>So our Savior, when his heart is raviſhed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the unconceivable Complacency, and Soul-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Satisfaction, he cannot make a meal of it; but he minds, and remembers the Father of his tender Lambs, and poor feeble Servants: O that my Members, and Faithful, might have a ſhare of this Love, but a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of it, though it coſt me more than wil be imagined.</p>
               <p>Thou loveſt them as Creatures, thou gaveſt them their Being, and thou preſerveſt it. He preſerves both Man and Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Thou pitieſt them as Sinners, thou haſt appointed a means for their relief, and thou haſt revealed it.</p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:66082:220"/>
               <p>Thou provideſt for them as Chriſtians, thou haſt ſent the means (bleſſed be thy Name) and haſt diſpenſed al thoſe glorious Helps of Life and Grace.</p>
               <p>And this is a high Favor, for thou haſt not dealt ſo with any Nation (though thou dealeſt wel withal) neither have the Heathen knowledg of thy waies.</p>
               <p>Thou tendereſt them as thy Saints appointed to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, with Grace, as given unto <hi>Adam;</hi> and he, as a man, had he kept the Covenant for himſelf, and his (and ſo a man by keeping of Covenant) had brought man to Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>But, bleſſed Father, thou haſt not only communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thy Grace, but thy ſelf unto me, thou haſt loved me before the World, and I have enjoyed the neereſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Thou in me, and I in thee;</hi> not as an infinite God, who haſt created al things, ſuſtaineſt what thou haſt created, governeſt, guideſt al things to their ends, and in their ends, for which they were created: But as a Father, I was with thee, as thine everlaſting delight, and lay in thy Boſom.</p>
               <p>O! this Love, this endeared, and intimate Love of a Father, let my feeble, poor Servants have ſome of that, ſome reliſh of that: As thou art in me, and I in thee; ſo they may be in me, and in thee alſo.</p>
               <p>O! let them have but a reliſh of this Love, I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; that they may be for ever refreſhed, everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>When the Spirits of Friends, are moſt indeared to thoſe that they would entertain with greateſt content, they are not ſatisfied to take what is next at hand, or content themſelves with ordinary, or common Proviſion, with courſe, or mean Fare; but they ſend far and neer, ſpare no coſt, nor care, nor pains, nor expences; but the beſt Rarities, fetched from the remoteſt places, purchaſed at deareſt Rates, preſerved in the moſt eſpecial manner, and that on purpoſe to give ſuch Perſons wel-come, to whom they are indeared as unto their own Souls, and
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:66082:220"/>would lay out their heart for their hearts content. It is ſo with our Savior.</p>
               <p>That the Saints may know his endeared Affection to them, and what Proviſion he hath laid in for their wel-come in Heaven, he leaves this as his laſt farewel upon their Souls: He tels them, he doth not purpoſe to ſet before them, ordinary Fare, common Courteſies, which he vouchſafes to al, as Life, Breath, and Being; poor Diet, of theſe periſhing things here below, of Profits, Pleaſures, Honors, and Applauſe. Nay, he cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf, how he may give the choyceſt, ſatisfying content to them: And therefore he looks out, not what Proviſion, Earth, or Heaven can afford; but what the Boſom, and Breaſt, and Heart-blood Affection of God the Father can afford.</p>
               <p>That Love wherewith thou haſt loved me the firſt of al, the greateſt of al, let out ſome of that, Righteous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto the fainting Souls of my Faithful Ones.</p>
               <p>This, Holy <hi>Paul</hi> praies for, as for the moſt precious Favor that could be obtained, as that indeed wherein the reſt iſſue, begs it upon his Knees, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I bow my Knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye may be ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit in the inward man: that Chriſt may dwel in your hearts by Faith, that ye may be rooted and grounded in Love:</hi> The end of al is, <hi>That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledg,</hi> verſe 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Height</hi> exceeds al Excellency, al Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, al Admiration. <hi>The Length</hi> exceeds the limits of al Time, from everlaſting to everlaſting. <hi>The Breadth</hi> exceeds the Bounds of al Being, none have received the impreſſions of ſuch Love.</p>
               <p>It is the Happineſs of the Supreameſt of the Angles, to have but the Reflection, and to come within the Shadow of this Love. Their Work and Happineſs, is to attend
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:66082:221"/>upon thoſe, that God hath taken ſo neer unto Chriſt, and himſelf in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As great Perſonages maintain their Gentlemen hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, to attend upon their Heir: They keep them at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> or ſome ſuch like place, becauſe they will have their Son and Heir there.</p>
               <p>They are miniſtring Spirits, ſent out for the good of thoſe that ſhal inherit Salvation.</p>
               <p>No Creature hath this, nor indeed is capable of this Love, but Man. As I might demonſtrate to you by the Courſe of Gods Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Depth</hi> being al the moſt inward, intimate, and enlarged working of al Creatures, let al the Affections of al Creatures be put together, let there be a Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and concurrence of al Fatherly, Motherly, Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Friendly, Natural, Spiritual Affections put together. This draws deeper than them al.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> expreſſed <hi>Jonathans</hi> Love; it was beyond the Love of Women, which are moſt ardent, and moſt vehement. That was but as one Creature might love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: but this is ſuch a Love, as God loves himſelf and his Son withal. And to procure this Love, the heart of our Savior was ſo ſtrongly carried, that he left Heaven, and his Glory, yea, loſt his Life, yea, was content to loſe Gods Love, that is, the ſence and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, which was better than Life it ſelf, that we might enjoy it. For he became a Curſe, that we might be bleſſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. He was willing to be forſaken <hi>(My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?)</hi> that ſo we might be received, and kept for ever, ſafe, in the Boſom of his Love, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46.</p>
               <p>And hither Chriſt would bring, and here leave us, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to depart from hence. And therefore he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf, that this Love was appointed, provided, prepared, tendred to the Saints, nay, enfeoffed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them; but that it might be with them, and remain in them for ever.</p>

                  <head>REASON.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Love</hi> we know, is an Affection of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> and by this, the neereſt Union betwixt Chriſt and his Saints, is procured: They are brought to lie both in the Arms of the Father; nay, to lodg in his Bowels and Boſom to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And therefore, as hath been mentioned before, there is that proper Relation, that peculiar Diſpoſition, to be found in the Second Perſon towards our Nature, and the Saints by that means; which is not to be found in the Father, or in the Holy Ghoſt. As the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he is the Head of his Church, which can be ſaid of none of the Perſons; it's an Hereſie to maintain it.</p>
                  <p>This Union of our Nature, is not only an impreſſion in the Soul, as a work upon the Creature: For then it had been common to al the Perſons. For al the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are created Expreſſions, are <hi>indiviſae,</hi> undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; what one doth, that al do.</p>
                  <p>This Union therefore, being a real Union <hi>(me non cogitante)</hi> though no man in the World, had a thought or apprehenſion of it: therefore beſide the impreſſion that is left upon the Creature, there is ſomwhat a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar operation iſſuing from the Second Perſon, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him alone; and by which it is, he is ſaid to be united, and none elſe. And therefore there is a peculiar kind of propriety and relation, which the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath in this Union, wherein he ſuits with our Nature, which is not to be found in any of the other; and that he muſt have as Second Perſon, becauſe it's his Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Hence we are called, <hi>Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone.</hi> Neerer than Fleſh and Bone, as neer as one part of the Bone to the other, one part of the Fleſh to the other.

                  <p>If once God love his, as his Chriſt, nothing can alter or hinder: If the ſame Love, the ſame Happineſs with Chriſt. This Love hath al, works al, is before al, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules al.</p>

That the world may know thou haſt loved them, as thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me. They did know, and they would not beleeve it, that there was ſuch love in God, or ſuch love towards men.</p>
                  <p>By this, God is admired in them that do beleeve. 2 Theſſ. 2.10. He is glorious in his Saints, but his glory is beyond comprehenſion, admirable, when the condition of the Saints, what they were, and hereby are, comes to be conſidered.</p>

No, ſay they, it wil never be. Happy they who are ſit to receive, but the Lord ſees them too good, and too much for me: And the Devil is ready at hand to add fuel to the fire, to help forwards ſuch groundleſs miſconceivings as they be. That he may mint and maintain hard thoughts in the Soul againſt our Savior Chriſt and his intended compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So he dealt with our firſt parents.</p>
                  <p>The Spark was no ſooner ſtirring and appearing, but he blows and increaſeth it, until it come unto a great Flame. <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhal not eat of every Tree?</hi> He knows that ye ſhal be as Gods knowing

Therefore the Lord profeſſeth himſelf offended with this way ward diſtemper of his froward Children.</p>
                  <p>The Father cares not for me, loves not me, thinks al too good for me, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27. Why ſai'ſt thou, O <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp; ſpeaks O Iſrael, my way is hid from the Lord?

                  </p>
                  <p>They may certainly expect that, which Chriſt deſires,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:66082:223"/>becauſe he ever attaines his deſires at the hands of God the Father. Joh. 11.42. I know that thou heareſt me alwaies, he is ſure to ſpeed and therefore they are ſure to poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt deſires this; Therefore they may expect it.</p>
                  <p>Nay, he not only deſires, but the ſtrength of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor is ſpent to this purpoſe, and its the end he aimes at. His deſire is ever anſwered, his labour ever bleſſed: And therefore the faithful may undoubtedly expect this love.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Chriſt makes it the main work on Earth, in Heaven, what he hath done, what he wil. I <hi>have made known, I will make known thy Name.</hi> He that hath al power, he is improving al power for this end and purpoſe, that this love may be ſetled and eſtabliſhed. Wil the Lord Chriſt looſe his labor? can he miſs of his end? can any thing oppoſe his power or prejudice his ſucceſs?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They can never looſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The love of the Father to Chriſt, nothing can alter that. The love of the Father to us is the ſame, nothing can change it. Our union, as his, nothing can ſeparate or break. Our communion, as his, nothing can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it.</p>
                  <p>Hither <hi>Paul</hi> repaires, and lands his heart and Hopes in ſafety. Rom. 8.38. — <hi>Nor things to come; Obj.</hi> Somthing is yet to come. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Come what wil come. This is his aim, to ſettle the concluſion of their happines, and the certainty thereof: To be beyond the reach of al the hoſts in Heaven and Earth. Therefore he muſters up al, what are, what ſhal be. If there were a thouſand worlds to come, and ſhould ſet themſelves to ſhake the comforts of the faithful, it could not be.</p>
                  <p>The ground is hence,</p>
                  <p>Becauſe of the love of God in Chriſt. It was before
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:66082:224"/>al theſe things; &amp; therefore they come too late to hinder it. It was without any repect, and therefore they could not work it. It was only and wholly from God: and therefore they cannot alter it. The Devils and ſin may as wel ſeparate Chriſt from the Father, as pul the love of the Father from his own heart, and ſo from Chriſt, as ſeparate us from it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its ground of greateſt contentment to the hearts of al Gods people in al their conditions.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt cannot love thee better than he doth, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide greater good for thee than he intends. Thou canſt have no more, I had almoſt ſaid, God can give thee no more.</p>
                  <p>Be therefore content with what thou haſt; our Saviors deſire is to intereſt thee in the heart and love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as himſelf. Not to love thee as a Creature, as a friend, a ſubject, but as the Son of his love. <hi>What me?</hi> Yea thee, poor, weak, ſilly, worthleſs Worm, that beleeveſt in him. Go thy way therefore, never quarel, nor queſtion any more; never murmur, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine any more. It is enough, nay it is too much. I would not have thought it. I durſt not have deſired it. I could not have beleeved it, but that our Savior hath ſaid and done it.</p>
                  <p>What, I beloved of the Lord Jeſus, miſerable wretch, who cannot but loath my ſelf, and Judg my ſelf worthy to be condemned? Yea thou. Therefore reſt thy weary heart in al thy weakneſs: do not think to bring ſuch meaſure of Grace to deſerve this love. Nay, lay hold of this love, and it wil increaſe the eminency of all Grace, and that in a glorious manner. <hi>Paul</hi> Prayes that the Epheſians may know this love, that they may be filled with all Gods fulneſs. Eph. 3.19.</p>
                  <p>View this wiſhly, and warm thy heart with it, and thou ſhalt not need to complaine of barrenneſs, thou ſhalt be ful of Grace. Nay, ful of al fulneſs of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Grace. No kind, no excellency of any kind that
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:66082:224"/>fits thy ſtation ſhal be wanting. How this is done, is not now to inquire, the Doctrine leads us to the ſame, while we conſtantly attend to the diſpenſation of Gods love in Chriſt begetting us as his Adopted ones to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: while we find this experimentally, and ſo know it, it leaves our hearts under the influence of it, as of him to receive al, and as from him to do al. What ever may be lacking to thy Hope, patience, meekneſs &amp;c. repaire to this love and know that there is no lack. I have the Choiceſt love of God that Earth, or Heaven, or the heart of God can afford. And that is beyond the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of al Grace, and al abilities that either I do want or can deſire. He loves me, therefore let him take what he wil from me, do what he wil with me, love wil ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply al. Give what he wil, love is better than al. As he, <hi>Am</hi> I <hi>not better than ten Sons?</hi> Gods love is better than al Graces and bleſſings, for it is the fountain of all.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Happineſs is a ful fruition of al Spiritual good things in ſo perfect a manner, as our feeble Natures are capable of,</p>
               <p>Two things are to be attended in the Deſcription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be a confluence and concurrence of all ſpiritual good things.</p>
               <p>For we now ſpeak of the happineſs of the Soul, and that which is inward and ſpiritual: not of any outward and temporal happineſs, which is to be found in theſe outward things, and belongs alſo to wicked men; For they may proſper in them. For they grow as the graſs, and workers of iniquity flouriſh. It was that which Jeremy ſaw, and that which ſome repine at; Jer. 12.1.
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:66082:225"/>
                  <hi>Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we ſpeak now of ſpiritual, Heavenly, and eternal happineſs, and the firſt ingredient which is here eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially required, is, <hi>That there muſt be a meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all ſpiritual good things.</hi> The gathering together of the Waters make the Sea: not the ſcattering of them in ſundry places, or the meeting of ſome little rivelets. So the gathering together of al ſuch ſpiritual excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, which anſwer the deſire and welfare of the Soul: Theſe make a compound of ſufficiency of ſupply, which we cal Felicity. As a Poſie of al Flowers. An Elixer, or Quinteſſence of al Cordials. Pſal. 144.15. <hi>Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe: Yea, happy is that people, whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe good things are conſidered, according to the pith, and ſubſtance of them, or according to the pleaſantneſs and ſweetneſs that doth attend upon them, and accompany them and the injoyment of them.</p>
               <p>The confluence of thoſe good things, wherein the Marrow of a mans happineſs eſpecially conſiſts, may be preſented to our apprehenſions in three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the whole Soul, and ſo the whole man, is ſo wholly poſſeſſed of al Grace, that it can and doth put forth the exerciſe of al vertues, Intellectual and Moral, of the underſtanding and wil, exactly, to anſwer al the rules thereof according as occaſion at any time ſhal cal for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Its not to have good, but to do good, which is a mans happines, Jam. 1.25. — <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſſed in his deed.</hi> To do wel is our greateſt welfare in this world. <hi>Adam</hi> had al Grace, but was not happy with that, but fel away from God, deſtroyed himſelf and his poſterity. But if theſe things abound, ye ſhal never ſal. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. And it was Epaphras his Prayer, <hi>That they might be perfect,</hi> and carried ful fail in every good wil of God.
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:66082:226"/>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. So far, as the Soul miſſeth, is weak, or wanting in any work, when God cals, ſo far he miſſeth, and fals ſhort of his happineſs, and miſſeth of the ful injoyment of his laſt end.</p>
               <p>That is to do al Gods wils, to wil Gods wils, to meet with him in every act, to give entertainment to him, and to take contentment in him. <hi>When we do his wil on Earth, as it is done in Heaven, we are then in the Suburbs of Heaven.</hi> He formed us for himſelf, and then we attain his end, and our own good alſo, when we ſhew forth his praiſe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. And therefore <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. He wiſheth that patience may have her perfect work, have the exerciſe of al trials and miſeries, that we may be handy at al weapons: when we have with meekneſs borne one evil, we may with quietneſs bear al,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what benefit wil there be in that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye ſhal be perfect, Entire, and wanting nothing.</hi> When we grow skilful in the bearing of al trials, we then out-bid al evils, we meet with, in others, and in our own hearts: meet with God in the exerciſe of al his rules, injoy him in al, and ſo our end and good in the bearing of it: and therefore can want no good: becauſe we are not wanting to any rule, nor exerciſe of any Grace or Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the whole Soul doth put forth the exerciſe of al vertues to anſwer Gods wil and pleaſe him: The Lord alſo, he freely and fully lets in himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates of al his glorious excellencies to the Soul, and fils it ful of himſelf, and the glorious expreſſions and operations of his Spirit, pleaſeth us, and applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us, whereby the Soul is furniſhed and fitted to do more and have more of God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſs. He that doth more for God, God communicates more to him. A good work is the reward of it ſelf. Do and live. That is, do, and be inabled to do. For, to <hi>live,</hi>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:66082:226"/>is to put forth <hi>acts of Obedience.</hi> And when <hi>Adam</hi> had pleaſed God, and attained this his Chief good and end, he could go no further, nor have any better, and therefore the reward was, That God would immutably aſſiſt him, that he ſhould be inabled to love him and pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>So that however the Lord God is the Objective hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Soul, and ſo the happineſs of al is equal, and the ſame, as God is the ſame: Yet the more the heart is inlarged for God and laies out it ſelf in holy ſervices for his honor:</p>
               <p>The more the Lord wil be in the communications of himſelf, and the more ful and effectual in lettings of his gracious preſence and operations of his Spirit into the Soul. And ſo the reward is proportioned to the work. <hi>Shall I withhold any thing from</hi> Abraham, <hi>for I know that he will command his Children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 18.17.19. He that loves and keeps: The Father and Chriſt wil come and manifeſt or ſhew themſelves to him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21.23. And 2 Chron. 16.9. <hi>He wil ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them, whoſe heart is perfect towards him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul acting upon God and meeting with him, in al the acts and exerciſe of the whole man, doth not only cloſe with the operations and expreſſions of God, let in: But laies hold upon that infinite excellency and ſufficiency in himſelf, and ſucks out a ſatisfactory ſweetneſs therein, through al eternity. For though it be the end of the Soul, being made for God, to work for him, and put forth al ſuch operations: yet I ſuſpect, the bare working is not al, nor the ful end of the Soul: But in this working to cloſe with God, and ſuck out a ſufficiency of ſupply from him. For no Creature, that is finite, can be the end of the Soul, nor give ſatisfaction to it. But all the expreſſions of God, let in, are ſuch.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:66082:227"/>Therefore there is ſomthing more required. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. The Lord is my portion. Whom have I in Heaven? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. Herein lies the pith of our happineſs; our pleaſing of God, our taking poſſeſſion, and ſo by frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion injoying of God. But ever with this good; wherein our bleſſedneſs doth conſiſt: There is ever a ſweetneſs and pleaſantneſs, that doth accompany the fruition of this, with a freedom and abſence of any evil or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the leaſt kind or meaſure that may hurtfully annoy.</p>
               <p>For where there is the fulneſs of an infinite good, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in it ſelf, ſuitable to our deſires or wants, there can be no grievance in reaſon poſſible.</p>
               <p>The Aromatical ſent of the Cordial is one thing, the Cordial another. The Poſie is one, the Smel ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If a man were free from al Grievance in Heaven, if the Soul ſhould not cloſe with God, nor God let in the expreſſions of his Grace; Heaven were a Hell.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is not our happineſs, but an attendant upon it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. and 63.3. Thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Member is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is done in ſo perfect a manner, as our Human Natures are capable of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That lies in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhal ſee and injoy God immediately, not by means. And 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>We ſhal ſee him as he is.</hi> And therefore not darkly, but clearly, not as vailed and covered in the works of Creation, but ſee him Face to Face. Therefore not ſee him ſparingly, and little of him, not as he drops himſelf in the means: and therefore we can ſee nor receive him in no other meaſure than they wil communicate: but we ſhal l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve at the Wel and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Head, he ſhal let out himſelf fully: <hi>We ſhal know as we are known.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28. <hi>God ſhal be all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="527" facs="tcp:66082:227"/>
               <p n="2">2. As there is nothing to leſſen the fulneſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of himſelf and goodneſs, ſo there is nothing to abate and take off the ſweetneſs of the good we do injoy.</p>
               <p>And this is the priviledg of Heaven: the unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beauty and brightneſs of the place may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zel us: but that it is free from the preſence of any evil. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. No evil thing was ever there to defile it, nor can come there to annoy it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. Far above al principalities and powers. Whereas had we been in the world, we ſhould have been amongſt Devils and his Angels, wicked and ungodly men, the preſence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would have been grievous to us, though they ſhould never have prevailed againſt us through their Malice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion comes to be the top of this happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If we receive more from God, and do more for him: by this then we are more happy. For the more we have of our end, the more happy we be.</p>
               <p>But by this we receive more from God, and do more for him. 1. <hi>More for him.</hi> Becauſe it was a principle of Grace which <hi>Adam</hi> received, when he was created, and it was that, which ſhould have been increaſed in a greater degree, if he had been glorified</p>
               <p>But when man was loſt, it was not the Creature, nor any mutable principle in the Creature, that could bring the Soul to God, or keep it with him.</p>
               <p>But God ſent his Son: and the God-Head of Chriſt in the Nature of man could only, and did only bring back the Soul to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Nay God did his beſt, as I may ſay, and put forth the higheſt ſtrain of his excellency. Here was wiſdom above al the Wiſdom of Creation to contrive this: Almighty
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:66082:228"/>power above al the power of the Creature to work this; Grace above al the Grace of Creation, that muſt eſtabliſh this: for that Grace which <hi>Adam</hi> had, he loſt.</p>
               <p>It was not now ſaying, <hi>Let man be Redeemed,</hi> But Chriſt muſt ſhed his Blood, or Els it could not be. 2. Theſſ. 1.10. — <hi>Admired in them that Beleeve.</hi> Admiration preſumes ſomthing not expected, or we cannot tel what to make of it when the Devils and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, who knew ſuch men in their unbeleeving courſes under the curſe ſhal ſee them pardoned, reconciled; they that were Enemies to God, made now one with God in Chriſt, they wil be aſtoniſhed at it, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.12. That the Name of Chriſt, as he is made known in his word and work of Redemption may be made glorious, he in the Father giving al, and that meerly out of Grace. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.31, 32.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We do more for God in Chriſt.</hi> For as he doth al by man, and he doth nothing: So he receives al from man, he takes nothing to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, man by Grace might have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed life, and communicated it unto man in way of Covenant. Now the Covenant of works is, <hi>do</hi> and <hi>live.</hi> Its God in Chriſt doth al: and therefore he muſt through Chriſt receive al. We were formed to ſet forth his praiſe, and ſo we do. I live not, therefore work not. But Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. We are his workmanſhip, Its not ours, of our ſelves. Eph. 2.10. <hi>We are kept by the power of God through Faith.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. And ſo ſanctified by the power of God, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the power of God through Faith &amp;c. Its Chriſt is made of God, Wiſdom, Juſtification, Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Redemption, and ſo al the glory goeth to God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the neerneſs of this Union, we ſuck out the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our end and laſt good, and ſo become happy
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66082:228"/>thereby. Its <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion of the glory of Heaven. 1 Theſſ. 4.17. <hi>We ſhall ever be with him.</hi> To be in Heaven doth not make us happy (look we at the place Barely as a place) but to be with Chriſt. This is but the Suburbs, or the verge and skirts of Heaven, by this we get into the inmoſt Room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> by Obedience and the Work of his Grace had met with him, and communicated of Grace from him, working as he wrought: but here is the Crown of his Glory.</p>
               <p>Not to be in Heaven, nor glorious by Grace in us; that is a Creature: but we to be in Chriſt, and by Chriſt in the Father, and the Father through Chriſt in us. Not <hi>with him,</hi> but <hi>in him.</hi> This is the Diamond in the Crown. And therefore the Lord Jeſus makes it one ſtep into the innermoſt Room, not to be in the ſight, but in the Arms of Chriſt. Not to have Chriſt a Spectator, but an In-dweller. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior makes this the end of glory, as in the foregoing verſe, and ſo better than glory. The glory thou haſt given me, I have given them, that thou mayſt be it them, and I in them. We are in Heaven, if glory may be in us, and we in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which carries the firſt and moſt ſupream and deepeſt impreſſion of the ſweetneſs of the chiefeſt good; that muſt cauſe our chiefeſt happineſs.</p>
               <p>Thou art in the bounds of Heaven, but in the Boſom, nay in the Bowels of the Father.</p>
               <p>This is the loweſt of al, ye cannot go deeper.</p>
               <p>The higheſt of al, ye cannot go further.</p>
               <p>This is ſomwhat beyond al Graces, beyond al Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſomthing above Heaven it ſelf. The firſt corner ſtone of our everlaſting unconceivable happineſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt Out-going of the God-Head was, He knew
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:66082:229"/>and conceived himſelf, and ſo begot his Son, as a lively Character and ſhine of his own perſon, and thence he owned him, and loved him, and took him into that neereſt union and communion.</p>
               <p>And at the next turn and ſtroak, he took a Creature neer to himſelf in his Son, as his Son, communicated with a Creature through his Chriſt, as his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Herein is the deepeſt, the deeareſt, the firſt, the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt of al.</p>
               <p>The expreſſion of common love, in the communication of common good, is of large extent.</p>
               <p>He is the firſt being, and gives being.</p>
               <p>He is Power, gives Power.</p>
               <p>He is good, doth good to al.</p>
               <p>But to be ſo nigh to him, and not to have common courteſies, but Fatherly kindneſs; its here firſtly.</p>
               <p>He is firſtly a Father to Chriſt, and ſo loves him, and in Chriſt, he loves thee as him. Now thou art at the higheſt and furtheſt.</p>
               <p>It was the firſt out-going of Gods love, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that ever was. More cannot be conceived, nor indeed expreſſed, unleſs we would have more and better love than Chriſt, which is unreaſonably and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably abſurd. He is firſt and we ſecond, not in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but in Gods heart.</p>
               <div n="1" type="application">
                  <head>USE, 1.</head>
                  <p>Its matter of Admiration; we may here ſee and be ſwallowed up with everlaſting wonderment, at the myſterious and uncomprehenſible depth of Gods diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in the covenant of Grace, and the Redemption of a ſinner by Chriſt; where he brings the greateſt good, out of our greateſt evil, the greateſt glory, out of the depth of our greateſt miſery; Advanceth us to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt top of Heaven and happineſs, out of the lower-moſt Hel of ſin and wretchedneſs, out of the greateſt eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:66082:229"/>from God. To bring a ſinner to the neereſt union and communion with God.</p>
                  <p>Thus God comes to be admired in thoſe that beleeve. The Devils have ſeen one holy and gracious, adorned and beautified with the Image of God. But he that was a Rebel, an enemy unto Chriſt, and a hater of him, as contrary to him, as darkneſs to light, to be neer to him, one with him, nay, to be in Chriſt and Chriſt in him: It is the wonderment of Angels, and the aſtoniſhment of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. And we ſhould be amazed at this myſterious mercy.</p>
                  <p>And it is true Lord, ſaies <hi>Solomon, That thou wilt dwel amongſt men?</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.27. But to be <hi>in them,</hi> to be <hi>one with them,</hi> and they with thee, <hi>Oh the depth of the riches of the Knowlegd and Wiſdom of God,</hi> How unſearchable are his waies, and his paths paſt fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out! To work our greateſt gaines out of our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt loſſes! To bring us by the bottom of Hel, into his own Boſom and Bowels!</p>

                  <p>As far as thou art from Union and Communion with God in Chriſt, ſo far from happines. 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you, unleſs ye be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi> Know ye not? prove and examine.

                  <p>Its a deſcription of the wicked. Job. 21.14, 15. <hi>They ſay to the Almighty Depart from us.</hi> They ſay ſo to the waies, the Grace, the Laws, the Government of God in Chriſt; we wil not walk in thoſe waies, nor
